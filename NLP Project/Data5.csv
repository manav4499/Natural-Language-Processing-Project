In an advisory posted Wednesday to a Syracuse University computer-science Web site, researchers said they had found vulnerabilities in Sharp's Zaurus SL-5500 and Zaurus SL-5000D handhelds. The flaws let attackers take control of the device's file system, giving them the power to overwrite files or lock the device so no data can be input through the keypad or touch screen.

ACLU: Don't rat out your customersA clutch of civil liberties groups is asking small Internet service providers to get a backbone and stand up to companies seeking to unveil anonymous critics.
A group including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the Center for Democracy and Technology is urging ISPs to alert customers when they are the targets of so-called John Doe legal actions, which try to unmask the identities of people who anonymously air their companies' dirty laundry. The group has sent letters to more than 100 ISPs, asking them to adopt a written policy promising to let customers know if they're targets.

BYLINE: DANA CALVO, TIMES STAFF WRITER
DATELINE: SEATTLEBODY:The idea came at the end of a long, frustrating brown-bag session at a
public-policy think tank here.The challenge was to save the city's child-care programs. Staring into
his empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator's mind landed on an
unlikely solution: Put a tax--just a ""benign"" dime a shot--on
espresso.That led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 Seattle residents,
and next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes law, one
that taps right into Seattle's legendary addiction to coffee. This is,
after all, the town where Starbucks was born and where the $12 pound
of beans became a staple. There is one Starbucks for every 7,000
residents in Seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in New York. Seattle
also has two other major coffee chains, Tully's Coffee and Seattle's
Best Coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts.A recent poll showed that 74% of Seattle residents would vote for the
tax. ""For people outside of Seattle who don't understand the
consumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,""
said John Burbank, the think tank's executive director, ""but it was
common sense.""Research by his nonprofit Economic Opportunity Institute showed that
people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. But
because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on
espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol.Burbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a
year. City Council aides dispute his figures, saying their research
shows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year.Burbank's institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. The
think tank's mission is to promote public policy in the interests of
low-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues.Burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs
made earlier this year by Gov. Gary Locke. He also says it would
provide more low-income families with subsidies for child care,
improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries.At Bauhaus Books & Coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of
customers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink.Espresso lovers like Chris Altman, who at a dime a day would spend an
extra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. ""I'm OK with
it,"" said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. ""The money's got
to come from somewhere.""Hope Revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she
brought her own mug) and reading ""Zen and the Art of Pottery."" She
supports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be
expected of espresso drinkers: They want the most expensive thing on
the menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy.Some say the tax isn't the issue; they just resent being singled out.David Marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a
day, which means he'd be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. ""I, for
one, don't have kids, but I drink espresso,"" he said, as he sewed a
leather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. ""I don't mind paying, but I
think everyone should pay.""Coffeehouses are steamed about it, and they've organized as
JOLT--Joined to Oppose the Latte Tax. Among the members are Seattle's
Chamber of Commerce and the city's two largest coffee franchises,
Starbucks and Tully's.The tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that
contains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare
for smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. If
espresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a
city audit.University of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone said the tax doesn't add up. ""The purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is
neither,"" he said. ""On the efficiency side, it's surely going to lead
to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to
avoid the tax. For example, Starbucks could claim that they are using
finely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker]
and that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. Would they be
right? I don't know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal
fees that could have gone to child care.""Of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingenious
idea, and I mean that in a cynical way. They've pitted espresso
drinkers against child-care supporters, and who's going to side with
the espresso drinkers?""In fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political
two-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public
stance of political correctness. In a liberal city like Seattle,
corporations continually advertise their commitment to social
activism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, JOLT members
prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care.""Starbucks will continue to support early-learning and
childhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we
contribute annually,"" the company said. ""However, Starbucks does not
understand why the Economic Opportunity Institute would recommend an
additional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single
consumer product.""The City Council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before
voters next year. The initiative's authors say it is directed at
vendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through
higher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee.
The tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of
espresso, including decaf. Drip coffee would be exempt.Burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of
consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he's been
pitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dime
every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.It's the kind of political marketing that Fran Beulah, 43, finds
funny. ""I drink espresso,"" she said, laughing, ""and I am not rich.""

2436,"Well, for one, it would free up the similar laptop I already got to
just run Amithlon (or if that wasn't so fun, bsd) to run just OpenBSD!This is a near-term thing I could look forward to!However, an 'official' laptop seems unexciting to me with only
the items mentioned.  Most important are the particulars distinguishing
the listed spec from a Dell 2650, preferably:
1- GeForce4 440 Go or newer, pleasingly modern GPU; the
   GeForce2Go (with 16MB video RAM; too little) I have is
   not so much too slow as inefficient; with factory settings it would
   actually crash from running too hot and too fast.
   (Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics
   is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments,
   but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and
    portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.)1.5- Great control over CPU state; by use of 'internet keys'
    wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll
    wheel.  Also, hibernate that works, please.1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones)
    in BIOS, please.2- P4 Dells overheat.  They have a big heatsink and a little fan
   to pull air through it, and if you don't elevate thelaptop off
   the desk or table or bed it's on, the fan will -stay- on.  Not good
  for MTBS (mean time between service; unless you've got an
  angle on making money on service from Amigans.....)
     One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs
  behind the AMLCD, thus using the backside of the display
  half as a radiator.; though it interferes with the case notion
  below.  (yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.)
      I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative
  mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle
  and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally
  provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them
  out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides
  of the laptop are met.)  This also happens to provide a little
  protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep
  plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) 3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the
    display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to
    -run with the backlight off.-  Again, to save battery power, but
    also as a feature; maybe you remember the iBooks modified
   in this manner.  The user has the privilege to pull out the
   backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with
   its backreflector, and the whole warrantee.  This provides
   for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted
   to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised.
     What would I like?  A1200 putty color, any translucency,
   in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see
   chocolate, firebrick and a couple of 'indian red' that are great
   candidates) base.  
      I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight
    without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external-
    light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare
    hood) to feed
    into the backlight.  Not only does this make an excellent 
    color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably.
      The logo should be a coloration of a
   minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew
   with:  demos at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/geometry/
   at first blush.  We'll see what comes out of the contest and
   maybe you'll like the mapping MathCAD does of the
   logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the
   openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community.
   MAA.org has more references, I'm sure.4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet.Other details:
USB2.x preferred; FireWire would be needed if that's unavailable.
Options like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port
should round out the offering.  An option for just-released 
.13 micron P4 (with mobile power features) could make more
reviewers greenlight the series; much better power consumption,
and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that.
CompactFlash, SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card
interfaces would be very pleasant.  I've mentioned booting to
USB, and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also.
To that end, a backup solution with compression using
USB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice 
bundle item; that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS.....
Blue skies (and clear water and fresh air): 
Waterproof to 30 feet, 3 Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi.
Svelte; 3-line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED,
builtin G4 cellphone functions, choice of side and 
frontpanel trim: Ivory-like stuff inscribed with M68k memory map
and various OS 3.9 structures or textured fur that
says 'This is Amiga Speaking' when stroked 'round. 
Decent keyboard, as in Toshiba or IBM laptops; perhaps 
an ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as 
keyboard and mouse) as the keyboard/trackpad.
2 Directional planar mics atop AMLCD; soundcard with multiple 
18 bit A-D and noise reduction DSP that work in our
(second-through-fourth, at least) favorite OS.
Actual 7"" bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation 
fan location for real void-comp (the test in Blade
Runner) style cooling and extended bass; active cooling
and airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user
seat and provide mineral water.
HyperTransport ports.

How is this any different from attaching an Infobot or A.L.I.C.E
through licq's console-hook?  People have been doing that for years,
and for over a decade in IRC and the MUDs.... and the one thing I think we've learned in all that time is that,
as a help-desk, it doesn't work.  People just don't like talking to
robots, especially when the robots, once confused, become imbeciles.
I think the humans may feel cheated, deceived and tricked when they
discover, as with the Seattle answer, that they are talking to a
machine; there's no real intelligence behind that simulated-friendly
and therefore empty 'thx'.AIML is clever and cute, but for /practical/ applications as a first
line of technical support?  It's been tried over and over, and while I
/also/ think that it /should/ work, for the most part, people won't
use it.  What's worse, as we make the NL processing more and more
clever, it only means it fails more dramatically; ALICE doesn't just
stumble a bit, it starts to drool.  And ALICE is the best we have.Like a Dalek: All very impressive when things are going well, but all
it takes to betray the chicken-brain inside is a towel over it's
ill-placed eye, or a spin off the metal surface ;)In all the prolog-based NL database query systems of the 1980's and
other later chatterbot helpdesk projects like Shallow Red, even
simpler tries like Ask Jeeves, people very quickly know they're
talking to a robot, and the queries anneal to short, truncated and
terse database-like verb-noun or just noun-keyword requests.  People are just too quick to adapt, and too impatient to forgive a
clunky interface, and for now, especially when the /average/ computer
user still can't type more than maybe 5-10wpm, NL is a painfully slow
clunky interface.Put it this way: Would you login, wake the bot and ask for the Seattle
weather, or would you do as we /all/ do and just click the weather
icon sitting there on your desktop?Just for fun, here's an interesting conversation between Shallow Red,
ALICE and Eliza as they decide to play the Turing Game:http://www.botspot.com/best/12-09-97.htm--

It will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. My name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party,  Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001.When the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, !
 En!
gland for 9years now. I am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my  master's  money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you.If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. To legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. For valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being.Please, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you.Yours sincerely,
Donald Phiri.

1983,"I need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I've read, the the
choices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE.
It seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec which
is a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is
somewhat simpler to setup. The problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites
run OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of
IPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a
significant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ?
If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever
on the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote
sites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity
in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.Niall--

The primary desert warfare facilities and schools ARE in the Southwest,
most notably Fort Irwin deep in the Mojave/Anza Borrego (the
headquarters and core training facilities for all things desert warfare
related), and have been for a long time. There are two reasons that
immediately come to mind as to why they do not use the Fort Irwin,
Edwards AFB, and other expanses of desert that they have traditionally
used for desert warfare training and exercises.  The first is logistical: Virtually all the mechanized infantry units are
located east of the Rockies, and it must be very expensive to move
entire heavy combat divisions a couple thousand miles every time they
want to run training exercises.  This is particularly true since so much
of our military is made up of reserve components these days, meaning
that you can't move the soldiers to where the training facilities are.The second is environmental lawsuits and pending judicial action and
injunctions. The desert training facilities in the Southwest deserts
have been aggressively assaulted by environmental organizations who are
making the case that heavy mechanized units zipping back and forth
across the deep desert endanger the desert tortoise and a bunch of other
theoretically endangered species that are concentrated in the southwest
deserts. The ability of the military to use the desert facilities has
been significantly impeded these days while all the lawsuits and whatnot
with the various environmental groups are being sorted out.-James Rogers

Tuesday October 8, 2002
The GuardianThey're chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancy
taste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they
are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants.
Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold
winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been
detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
""This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,"" said
Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London
who discovered the creatures in the UK.
The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous
damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species,
otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known
north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. ""It's very likely
these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental
plants from Italy,"" said Dr Barclay. ""It looks like they're here to stay.""
He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store
in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a
migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in
south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has
established itself firmly in the same area.
Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and
grape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The
soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.
One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of
Britain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a
fact.

is thinking harder about real people  than the rest of us, and he may
be able to get use out of approaches that identify closely related spam.
For example, some amount of spam is going to end up in the ham training data

may be an aid in finding and purging it.",0

5040,"First, 1,000 people will have seen the piece of spam that could've been avoided.  But the other 99,000 will never see that spam.  Evenly distributed, it means that an average user will only see 1% of spam.  That's not realistic, because not everyone will get the same spam, but the basic threshold can be adjusted.  At the very least, 30 people need to ""vote"" on a given piece of mail to make a realistic decision.  Since there's no ""no"" vote mechanism (except revocation--and that's after the fact), only a ""yes"" vote mechanism exists and so if you received 30 ""yes"" votes then you could safely say that you got a reasonable sample.The system could pretend to have never seen the piece of mail until after it determined that it was probably spam.  So instead of a rating going up incrementally, it would take a big leap at the beginning (from undefined to a relatively high number) and then go from there.  So after the first group of people (our samplers, we'll say) have seen the spam, no one else would ever see it.As far as unsubscribing, I'm always leery of clicking on the link (and don't do so unless I specifically remember signing up for something), but the sample population will decide for themselves whether they feel that it's spam.So ultimately, I guess I'm saying that the most effective route would be to use a constantly changing sample pool and just accept that there is some fraction of users that will have to see the spam.  In a system that depends on people deciding whether or not something is spam, is there any other way?Isaac-----Original Message-----

simplistic view would be that 999 subscribers received a piece of spam
that could have otherwise been avoided. But the reality is likely that
many, many more individuals would have received the piece of spam when you
factor in report times.> By having the server pretend to never have seen it, you can avoid

something already in the database. If you have the system pretend to have
never seen a piece of mail, how do you propose people use the system for
filtering?> What about revocations?  A revocation is after the fact because a

2078,"http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/ed/front/481722Pro-hunt activists target top sightONE of Yorkshire's most famous sights yesterday became one of the first
targets in bizarre attacks on White Horse landmarks linked to the hunting
debate.
Villagers near Thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday
to find the famous White Horse of Kilburn had acquired a rider during the
night.
In another incident, the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire had a huntsman
and three hounds added to the ancient figure, which is thought to represent
a Celtic god or tribal symbol.
Pro-hunt activists in the Real Countryside Alliance (RCA) Â­ a radical
alternative to the better-known Countryside Alliance Â­ admitted
responsibility last night for targeting the two images.
The 314ft by 228ft landmark at Kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it
was carved in the limestone by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils in
1857.
But during Monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman
with a horn Â­ which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white
carpet. It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse
Association, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.
John Roberts of the association said: ""It has obviously been very well
organised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a
horn cut out of carpets.
""It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it
to bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings
to be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will
not get another refit for another year.
""Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle Â­ a tractor and trailer or a
lorry Â­ because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely
well planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off.""
The sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south
of England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs
whitening.
Mr Roberts added: ""The damage as such is not great but it adds to the
deterioration, which means it will need more work next time.
""We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to
take it away again because it was a major job.""
Andy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:
""It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud
of it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful
consideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of
vegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There
has not been a cut in the turf Â­ which would be much more of a problem. It
would seem it was carefully plotted beforehand.""
An RCA spokesman said: ""Some people in the country are getting very
frustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches
don't seem to be doing anything good.""
The Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.
Spokesman Adrian Yelland said: ""The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates
campaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and
regrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident.""
The incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in
Yorkshire thought to be RCA work.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

currently on trial in Paris for calling Islam ""the stupidest
religion""...http://ca.news.yahoo.com/020917/5/ozxa.html# Tuesday September 17 11:07 AM EST
#
# French Writer Tried As Anti-Islam, Protest Erupts
# By Caroline Brothers
#
# PARIS (Reuters) - Provocative French novelist Michel Houellebecq
# faced a Paris court on Tuesday for allegedly inciting racial hatred
# by calling Islam ""the stupidest religion"" and its holy book the
# Koran a depressing read.
#
# The case, brought against him by four Muslim groups, is a cause
# celebre reminiscent of the Salman Rushdie affair, pitting freedom of
# expression against religious sensitivities.
#
# The Muslim groups, which include the Mecca-based World Islamic
# League and the Paris Mosque, accuse the writer of insulting Islam in
# an interview with the literary magazine ""Lire"" during last year's
# launch of his novel ""Plateforme.""
#
# Lire is also on trial over the remarks, which have taken on an added
# significance in France in the atmosphere of heightened sensitivity
# and concern about Islam following the September 11 attacks by Muslim
# radicals in the United States.
#
# Shortly after the trial started, 11 people in the courtroom stripped
# off their shirts to reveal T-shirts saying ""No to the censure of the
# imams"" and ""Marianne veiled, Marianne raped"" -- a reference to the
# female symbol of the French republic.
#
# ""Freedom of expression! freedom of expression!"" they and other
# Houellebecq supporters chanted after they were thrown out of the
# courtroom at the main law courts in central Paris.
#
# While intellectuals argued before the trial that Houellebecq should
# be free to write what he wants, Lyon Mosque rector Kamel Kabtan
# retorted: ""We are for freedom of expression, but not for insulting
# communities.""
#
# BETE NOIRE
#
# Houellebecq, 45, the bete noire of contemporary French literature,
# is no stranger to controversy. He offended conservatives and the
# politically correct left with his 1998 novel ""Les Particules
# Elementaires"" (""Atomised"" in English).
#
# Paris Mosque rector Dalil Boubakeur says Muslims have been insulted
# once before by Houellebecq, who had the main character in Plateforme
# admit he felt ""a quiver of glee"" every time a ""Palestinian
# terrorist"" was killed.
#
# The World Islamic League, the Lyon Mosque and the National
# Federation of Muslims in France have joined the Paris Mosque in
# bringing Houellebecq to trial.
#
# France's Human Rights League joined them as a civil party, saying
# Houellebecq's comments amounted to ""Islamophobia"" and deserved to be
# sanctioned as part of the league's struggle against discrimination
# and racism.
#
# The Paris Mosque has hired Jean-Marc Varaut, one of France's leading
# trial lawyers, whose past clients include Maurice Papon, the former
# official condemned in 1998 for Nazi-era crimes against humanity for
# sending Jews to death camps.
#
# RESTORING BLASPHEMY?
#
# Houellebecq's lawyer Emmanuel Pierrat argues that the case
# effectively re-establishes the notion of blasphemy, despite the fact
# that France as a secular state has no such law, and says
# Houellebecq's opponents want to deny him freedom of expression.
#
# He also argues that the interview in Lire truncated a six-hour
# conversation and Houellebecq was not given the chance to approve the
# article before it appeared.
#
# Houellebecq's publisher Flammarion has distanced itself from the
# author, whose comments some say may have cost him France's
# prestigious Goncourt prize -- for which he had been a contender.
#
# The novelist, who lives outside Cork, Ireland, writes in a detached
# style about a bleak world in which people have forgotten how to
# love.
#
# Translated into 25 languages, ""Atomised"" incensed France's 1968
# generation with its scathing descriptions of the hippie era but won
# him France's November prize in 1998 and the Impac award, one of the
# world's biggest fiction prizes.
#
# Losing his case may mean a year in jail or a $51,000 fine.- Gordon

4675,"> Interesting. I've always wondered about things 'considered' to be bad. 
> Example the GOTO, most languages support a goto of some sort, so are gotos really bad?Oh goodie. My final year project rears its head :-)> Is a loop or a recursive call actually any better than a goto 
> or is the goto used as a kind of common enemy of 
> programming syntaxMuch as I would like to answer an unqualified ""yes"", I must admit: if 
you already code in a style that makes heavy use of GOTOs, coding in the 
same style with GOSUBs or function calls does not improve code. Much the 
same as when the manuals on ""modular coding"" said to write modules that 
would fit on a single sheet of computer paper, lots of coders proceeded 
to split their code into arbitrary 60-line chunks. :)However, ""Go-to considered harmful"" points out that to analyse (==debug) 
code, you need to be able to tell what the point of execution is, and 
what the values of the variables are at that point. This is an easy(tm) 
job if the code uses assignment, if(), for() and functions, but not if 
it uses GOTO. (See http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF 
for the full letter).Despite being one of Dijkstra's brain-damaged children who learned BASIC 
at an early age :) I never use GOTO anymore (or any of its bastard 
offspring like break, continue, fudged function calls with sleight of 
hand in the variables). My code is longer than it might be if I had used 
GOTO at a critical, handy point. However, code is a bit like networks - 
you always end up adding bits on where you didn't expect to - and the 
benefit is felt when another person (like myself but in three months 
time) is modifying or debugging it and doesn't have to go through the 
hassle of dealing with the impact of the GOTO.Dave

communications.  its anything and everything.  avg person could easily send
half dozen pics to a dozen people a day.  mainly humorous i'd guess. who
cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.display: why are dig camera displays better than cell phones?  does anyone
know who makes these small displays and what the trends are around them?misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same
thing about '1 hour photo' processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better
resultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the plant
had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital camera,
and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of
decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the
photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS
didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its
greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS
traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,
SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.ps:  it is relatively amusing that one 'low resolution' complaint dropped
just after Joe watched a CARTOON on his television..You're right. Or at least, I don't. I saw an advert for it on TV last
night (can't miss Futurama :-) and I thought, ""boy, that's dumb.""

Subject: [ILUG] OSI protocol
There's been some discussion just now on the ILUG IRC channel about OSI and
protocol layers. This reminded me of a poster produced by Wandel &
Goltermann (manufactureres of fine protocol decoders and testers) which
illustrates this admirably. The poster is in the form of a PDF file and to
be honest, is best appreciated if you have access to a HP DesignJet or
somesuch device. Wandel & Goltermann has now become/been taken over by
acterna and I couldn't find the poster there. However, it's available at
http://www.pb.bib.de/~dozloh/fachinfo/sdn_16/decodes.pdf and some of you ma
find it interesting.The top of the poster refers you to www.decodes.com for a more up to date
online copy of the poster. However, www.decodes.com now is redirected to the
aforementioned acterna and . . . .

seems to have 'issues' with crosslinked files - for instance, it was
trying to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and failing. It was only
as I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and
queried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist on

>
> What's the point of multiple email addresses? They're a pain.

Ah the great spam debate wages on ...So where's Kragen in this whole mess ;-)Eugen, the reason for multiple email addresses (at least _my_ reason) is
that I like to separate my friends from say, FoRK, from say, my school
accounts, from say my spam box.   I tend to get a veritable buttload of
mail from various sources, and sometimes I don't have a chance to go
through it all.   I have it mostly setup on a filter basis (those friends
that go to the carey@ address do get filtered _generally_ speaking into
the friends box, those fork posts, _generally_ go into the FoRK pile. )  
Its still nice to know that if I need to get someone's response and I
haven't gotten around to putting them into the friends section of my
carey@ address, that I can give them another address (bitbitch, which gets
considerably less traffic) and I can be assured of flagging it down.
When I setup my PC to run BSD and then I can get sendmail or procmail or
whatnot to be a better mail program and  I can spend the time making even
_better_ filters than The Bat! provides for me now, I'll probably change
my mind on the multiple email address thing.   I still like knowing that I
can send the assholes (or undesirable guys I don't feel like dating ;)  to
my @hotmail account.I'm also going to also rescind my prior request not to have a member-only
fork.   As snobby and elitist as a member-only FoRK would be, I'm starting
to feel the pain of the whole spam to bits ratio on fork.   I'd be
willing, multiple email addresses and all, to sign up for a whitelist
provided the system could handle email sent from say cnn.com that was
referenced to my address (say the On Behalf of) emails that a few of us
tend to send.   Does such a system exist?  I'm rather ignorant on the
whole whitelist concept, and I know a few of you are far far more
knowledgable.My half a cent here...: I will be so damn glad when I am done with this whole moving
thing... back on fork when I'm in NH.. :)

                    in the brain and declines with age, so it is a natural substance 
                    already in your body right this moment. HGH is known as the 
                    master hormone because it exerts effects over all other hormones 
                    in the body, including Testosterone, Estrogen, Progesterone 
                    and DHEA. Augmenting declining somatotropin levels by giving 
                    your body daily ingestible somatotropin, can create a more 
                    youthful hormone balance that results in dramatic improvements 
                    in your health.
                    Â  Somatotropin supplementation 
                    is a life-enhancement. Lives that were once shattered by fatigue, 
                    illness or the ravages of aging, now fourish with the help 
                    of somatotropin supplementation.
                    Â  Somatotropin from the pituitary 
                    works by stimulating protein production in all tissues of 
                    the body. This results in an increase in organ healing and 
                    regeneration, which is associated with increase resistance 
                    to illness and injury.
No matter your age, we GUARANTEE
                    you will look and feel BETTER than

Date: Not suppliedRob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger and others at the O'Reilly OS X con have tracked 
down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network here -- every 
20 or 30 seconds, you start getting ""connection refused"" messages from your 
browser and other net-utilities. It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
""promiscuous"" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a ""rejected"" message. So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa).

meetings do (try very hard) not to drink.As to religion, I think it is harmful and risky in
almost any degree. Were I single, I might consider
potential mates who partook of the less irrational
or more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian or
Buddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccan
of the second. But someone who is both irrational
and serious about that irrationality strikes me as
a bad choice of partner, moreso than someone who
was addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drug
addicts at least have the sense to battle their
problem, and to keep their children from suffering
it. The religious revel in their irrationality,
and want to raise their children in it. That's a
difficult difference for two parents to
reconcile.Fortunately, I am long and happily enamored of

    America. I am writing you this letter in confidence regarding my current 
    circumstances.     I escaped the United States ahead of death squads with my husband and two 
    children Jenna and Frank, moving first to England and then, when my 
    husband's political enemies took power there, to Austria. All of our 
    wealth, obtained legitimately through baseball, oil drilling and insider 
    trading, was seized by the new government of the USA under the despotic 
    regime of (Dr.) Noam Chomsky, except for the contents of a few Swiss bank 
    accounts. These bank accounts, which contain social security lock-box funds 
    and the bulk of the 2001 budget surplus, could not be accessed by me or my 
    children, due to agreements made between the socialist government of the 
    USA and Swiss bank regulators. They seized our ranch in Crawford, Texas and 
    now use it to teach homosexualist propaganda to schoolchildren.  Link[2] Discuss[3] (_Thanks, Stefan!_)[1] http://atrios.blogspot.com/2002_08_18_atrios_archive.html#80547516

the ability to insert different sigs on demand.  Create a bunch of

exmh will load them all.  In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign...

you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows

the existing Sedit window prior to composition.I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, 
exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the 
script as your signature.I hope this helps some.

>By David Friedman 08/08/2002David is a very bright fellow. But this time he's
several years behind. The idea of using epostage
to stop spam has been discussed quite a bit. The
problem is how to get over the adoption hump.
Until most people are taking one form of epostage,
most people don't have enough incentive to download
and install something that allows them to pay it.
Until most people are set up to pay it, any form of
epostage I require closes my mailbox to unknown
senders from whom I want to receive mail. And even
from known senders. Giving someone my email address
doesn't automatically put them in my white list.Hashcash tries to lower the adoption barrier by
removing the need to pay money for epostage.
Instead, the sender burns processing time on his
computer, answering a cryptographically hard
challenge. But even this requires set-up. There is
inadequate incentive to do so until there is a
standard mechanism, but no standard mechanism is
born until a significant fraction of the market
has taken that first step. It may take government
action, to institute an effective epostage
standard!I think the better idea is to require that people
off your white list ""hand sign"" email to you. A
couple of companies are now trying to implement
this. An email sender, if not on your white list,
must respond to a verification email or go to a
website, by a process that is very simply for a
human sender, but difficult for a spammer to
automate. Where epostage requires a standard
mechanism, a variety of mechanisms for ""hand
signing"" would frustrate spammers while making it
no more difficult for legitimate senders. I'm
hoping Eudora and some of the other big mail
clients incorporate this kind of feature. The
advantage to putting this in the mail client is
that the required ""hand sign"" can be personalized:  ""Your attempt to email David Friedman is
  blocked until you fill in the blank: The
  Incredible ______ Machine.""It will be a long time before spammers have a
process that defeats millions of personal
challenges. On the other hand, I have a hack in
mind that would work a large percentage of the
time. But I'm not telling. If spammers did figure
out such hacks, people would then improve their
challenges. Yeah, this would lead to another
arms race, and spam would leak through to the
unwitting. But this arms race is one that helps
spammers identify and target the part of the
population whose challenges are sub-par, which
is their natural prey. People like David aren't
in the market for herbal Viagra or back alley
debt consolidation.Since David is an anarchist, I'm surprised he
didn't point out that spam is the result of
government. The government is ineffective at
preventing spam, but it DOES prevent individuals
and ISPs from taking retribution against spammers.

Subject: REVOLUTION OS is now authorized for UC Santa Cruz screeningTo all,I have read the series of e-mails related to the unauthorized UC Santa
Cruz screening that was scheduled for June 1.  I sincerely appreciate
IEEE's good faith effort to correct the mistake.Consequently, so as not to inconvenience the people planning to attend
the screening, I want to give IEEE and SlugLUG permission to screen
REVOLUTION OS at 1 PM on June 1.  I would ask the members of SVLUG to
hold off on attending the screening for the simple reason that I am
trying to get REVOLUTION OS booked into the Camera 3 in San Jose, and I
would prefer that SVLUG's members have a chance to see a nice 35mm print
of the film.  If my distributor is unable to book the film into a
theater in the Bay Area, I promise that I will work with SVLUG to
quickly set up a screening for its members.I realize there may be some members of SlugLUG who are unhappy that I
originally requested that they not hold an unauthorized screening of
REVOLUTION OS.  There are several reasons why I made the request, and
none of them have anything to do with me wanting to be a jerk.  One SlugLUG member commented that it was odd that a movie about the Open
Source movement would not be available for open viewings.  Another
SlugLUG member remarked that my request smacks of Bill Gates's Open Letter
to Hobbyists.  The bottomline is that I did make a film about the Open Source movement,
but to assume that automatically means that the film is itself Open
Sourced seems to be a little bit of a stretch.  If I made a movie about
the history of vegetarianism that would not automatically mean I'm a
vegetarian.  I simply thought Open Source and Free Software were compelling subjects
worth exploring and documenting.  As a result, I came to admire many
aspects of the Open Source movement and chose to focus the documentary
on the movement's positive history.  However, I do not think I should be
punished for telling the story of Free Software and Open Source by
having my intellectual property misappropriated.   More practically, my
feelings about Open Sourcing REVOLUTION OS are abundantly clear when you
see the explicit copyright notice at the end of the film's credits.  I realize that making a videotape copy for personal use from a TV airing
is considered fair use.  I believe in a healthy fair use doctrine. 
However, there is a big difference between viewing your personal copy at
home with a few friends and holding a publicly advertised screening on a
university campus.  So I freely admit my objection to unauthorized
screenings of REVOLUTION OS does echo Bill Gates's letter.  Personally, I
believe that the creator of a piece of intellectual property should
retain the choice to Open Source their IP.  If the Open Source movement
is not voluntary then it is really just piracy.One of the reasons I am concern with unauthorized group screenings of
the film, is that my distributor is planning in a few weeks to begin
selling VHS copies of the film for educational/institutional use with a
license permitting noncommercial large group screenings.  We hope to use
the money from these sales to fund the authoring and replication of the
DVD.  I want to release the DVD as soon as possible, but I cannot afford
to take on anymore REVOLUTION OS-related debt.  Thus the importance of
preserving the educational/institutional market.Frequently, I will read comments on Slashdot and other mailing lists
that justify the piracy of music on the grounds that it benefits the
artists and only hurts the greedy record labels.  Well, in the case of
REVOLUTION OS there is no multinational media conglomerate to punish. 
It's just me.  I made and financed the film on my own.  I have worked
full-time for almost three years without a salary.  The only way I will
get out of debt and have a chance to make another film is if people seek
out legal opportunities to view REVOLUTION OS.I truly appreciate the enthusiasm of the Open Source community for
REVOLUTION OS, and I am grateful that people do want to see it.  If you
will just bare with me, I will figure out a way for all interested
persons to legally view it.I hope the dust up over the unauthorized, and now authorized, screening
at UC Santa Cruz has not inconvenienced anyone.Sincerely,J.T.S. Moore
Director, REVOLUTION OS

Is there a relatively clean way to dynamically build comp files based on
the path of the current folder?  Yeah, I know exmh will pull the first comp in the path up from the
  current folder to the mail root, but that's not what I want.I'm starting to use plus addressing heavily as part of my SPAM controls.
Specifically I each mailing list with a list-specific address.  eg I would subscribe to this list as claw+exmh@kanga.nu or perhaps
  claw+exmh-users@kanga.nu instead of claw@kanga.nuHowever to do this I need a new set of comp files for each list folder.
As I'm subscribed to something just over 600 lists, that's rather a
pain.  I really don't want to go create and maintain ~1,800 comp files
(components, replcomps, replgroupcomps), especially not as I suspect
I'll be changing or adapting my naming pattern a few times as I adapt
various supporting tools.What would be great is if I could build the relevant comp file
dynamically at runtime.  That way I don't need to maintain a couple
thousand comp files, I just need to make my plus addresses
predictable/computable based (say) on the folder path.  eg I'm currently in folder:    +-Lists-/Products/Exmh-L    The script would dynamically build a compfile which had a From: of
    claw+exmh@kanga.nu for repl, comp, etc.  Similarly when in folder:    +-Lists-/Linux/SVLUG-L  I'd get a From: of claw+svlug@kanga.nuThat way I can use lookup tables for those folders which have multiple
lists being delivered into them.Any ideas how this might be done in an automatic/maintainable fashion?
It would be more than good enough if all I had to do was drop a tiny
FROM_HEADER file in each folder that somehow got picked up by the comp
file...--

Red Hat Network has determined that the following advisory is applicable to
one or more of the systems you have registered:Complete information about this errata can be found at the following location:
     https://rhn.redhat.com/network/errata/errata_details.pxt?eid=1159Security Advisory - RHSA-2002:158-09
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary:
New kernel update available, fixes i810 video oops, several security issuesUpdated kernel packages are now available which fix an oops in the i810 3D
kernel code. This kernel update also fixes a difficult to trigger race in
the dcache (filesystem cache) code, as well as some potential security
holes, although we are not currently aware of any exploits.Description:
The 2.4.18-5 kernel introduced some safety checks in the VM subsystem that
were triggered when exiting an X session while using 3D acceleration with
the Intel i810/i815 chipset. Additionally, there was a difficult to trigger
race in the dcache of the file system subsystem.This kernel update addresses both of these issues.In addition, there are fixes for potential security holes in the following
drivers:stradis
rio500
se401
usbvideo
apmFinally, this kernel fixes a few files in the /proc file system which had
the capability to expose kernel memory when abused.All of the security issues found during an audit and none of them,  at the
time of this writing, have any known exploits.We would like to thank Silvio Cesare, Stas Sergeev, Andi Kleen, Solar
Designer, and others for their auditing work.References:

started playing with this - I'd collected spam for a week or two, 
then mixed it up with randomly selected messages from my mail boxes.course, it instantly picked up on 'received:2001' as a non-ham. Curse that too-smart-for-me software. Still, it's probably a good
thing to note in the documentation about the software - when collecting
spam/ham, make _sure_ you try and collect from the same source.

Apparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers volunteering a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations. 
Linux users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to 
spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a 
good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for organizations that might be in need of such skills. And, I've 
seen some very interesting suggestions for names for our project. Feel free to click through on any of the 
above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though. keep the 
subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and sort 
through my email system.It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users. 
According to this article on The Register, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee on its
previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an OS 10.2
upgrade at $129.I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how 
difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years. Revenues, 
by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s and early 
2000. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income, some of which 
were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch in the past few 
years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the newsletters will remain 
free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative income sources.On a brighter note, it looks like Mandrake has found a sweet spot. According to their most 
recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest in the 
company's
history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue. That doesn't put
them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the strong quarter will
only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much of this revenue was
the result of the Mandrake Linux User's
Club.The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest
partnership venture, an agreement with Microtel to provide Mandrake-loaded computers for sale on WalMart.com.
I would never have guessed that WalMart would lead the consumer Linux machine
charge. They've had Mandrake boxes available for several months. Now, with the 
addition of both Lindows 
and Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail 
computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.Have a great Wednesday.

procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong 
contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE 
desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't 
automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much 
time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the 
additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an 
irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple 
configuration issue.To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in your KDE panel. Select ""Preferences"" and the ""Execute"" tab. In the Execute 
window, change the command line to read:Â Â Â Â kmail --check -caption ""%c"" %i %mThe addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when 
you open the program.Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?

Kernel Configuration - Part XIIIAs you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for 
networking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to 
stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel 
configuration is dense with details and options.I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of 
the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock 
configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas. 
You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be 
used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external). Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos:
The Linux Security Quickstart HowTo
Â Â covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel 
configuration issues
Linux Network Security from Linux Planet
Â Â a nice tutorial on network security
Network Security with /proc/sys/net/ipv4
Â Â other approaches to network security
These should get you started. Tomorrow, we'll cover telephony support in your 
Linux kernel.

Linux PR
http://linuxpr.com/If the daily Linux news sites are starting to get you down, maybe it's time for

the Linux world. The layout is attractive, with all the most recent articles in 
descending order on the front page. It makes quick scans easy. The only real 
downside to the news on the site is that some of it is very, very

Other than that, Linux PR is a useful site for checking in and keeping up on

   *  A printed copy of your key ID, key type, fingerprint, and key sizeI will pass out a master list (from what people send me now). Then
individually we will cross-validate eachothers identities and keys.It works like this: person A tells B the details of their key (from
their personal copy of the key info). Person B confirms that the key
information on the master list matches. Next person A produces photo ID
for person B. If it proves that person A is the owner of the key, then
person B can check off that person on their list.The reverse is then done for person B.After a while you will end up with a list full of (hopefully) checked
names. Later on, you can retrieve a copy of the key either from a
keyserver or directly from the owner, verify it's valid (it matches the
checked off name on your copy of the master list), and sign it using
your private key.Then you can upload your signature of the key to a key server and send a

I'm sure this is common knowledge already, but just in case ...http://security.tombom.co.uk/shatter.html   This paper presents a new generation of attacks against Microsoft
   Windows, and possibly other message-based windowing systems. The
   flaws presented in this paper are, at the time of writing,
   unfixable. The only reliable solution to these attacks requires
   functionality that is not present in Windows, as well as efforts on
   the part of every single Windows software vendor. Microsoft has
   known about these flaws for some time; when I alerted them to this
   attack, their response was that they do not class it as a flaw -
   the email can be found here. This research was sparked by comments
   made by Microsoft VP Jim Allchin who stated, under oath, that there
   were flaws in Windows so great that they would threaten national
   security if the Windows source code were to be disclosed. He
   mentioned Message Queueing, and immediately regretted it. However,
   given the quantity of research currently taking place around the
   world after Mr Allchin's comments, it is about time the white hat
   community saw what is actually possible.

There are specific statutory exemptions to the ""first sale"" principle of
fair use in the US.  For example, audio recordings have such an
exemption (dating from the early '80s IIRC), which is why you can't
(legally) be in the business of renting audio CDs; the creators can
control what you do with it after they've sold it to you.  Certain
industries would like to extend similar exemptions to other products --
there is no theoretical limit to what Congress could revoke such
privileges on.

The problem with the entertainment industry is that they engage in
business and pricing tactics that make anything Microsoft was ever
accused of pale in comparison.  If they can't figure out how to make
money doing something, they'll actually burn money to make sure no
""industry outsider"" can either for all intents and purposes; control is
more important than maximizing profit as long as they can make a
profit.  They don't need your carrot, so they only engage in reasonable
business behavior when you are carrying a very large stick, and few
people swing a stick large enough.  They are being chronically
""investigated"" by the DoJ for anti-trust, collusion, and similar
activities, but that is mostly just for show.Which isn't to say that the entertainment industry won't fall victim to
its own stupidity, but their ability to do arbitrary and capricious
price manipulation with impunity is going to make it a slow decline.-James Rogers

The thing is, I hadn't used gconf-editor yet... and it's exactly what I
feared, old ""not so good"" memories are coming back : It looks exactly like
a GNOME RegEdit :-/ Oh well.
I still hope that the few missing features I'm still looking for will be

panel always under *all* other windows (if you know how to do that, I'm

5788,"TITLE: Potential remote root in CodeBlue log scanner
NAME: DEMI SEX GOD FROM HELL ADV 00001
DATE: YES, PLEASE MAIL ME IF YOU ARE FEMALE (send pictures)
CRAZY TRACKING NUMBER THAT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE SOME MASSIVE DATABASE OF
JUAREZ: 7363A64B02Props to dme@#!Information
-----------you may remember me from sweaty nights of passion, or perhaps from yesterday when
i announced the release of a piece of software i wrote (many years ago too
btw).in general i received no feedback from this, cept from one guy having problems
downloading it (howd that go btw?) and then this:From: ""Michael""
To: ""'Demi Sex God from Hell'""
Subject: RE: ass the attack spoofing shellAnnoying. Pointless.well! how very very rude. that really was uncalled for. (propz to dme yo!).
gay, bi or curious, i went to find out more about mystical michael, who is
obviously very important as he is the only one who felt the need to tell me
they didnt like me. it turns out, hes a bit of programmer, with some code
available on his website (www.tenebrous.com). I got codeblue, (btw mystical
mike your auto-download script for you counter gives me a 500 error), a log
checking utility mystical mike wrote and released under the GNU GPL to make
the world a better place.If this tool is run as root (say nightly from roots crontab) there is a
potential remote root. in any case, regardless of user, there is
always a remote. if codeblue is locally suid, theres many overflows all
throughout it, easy peasy like the girls in st patricks!!!.Note st patricks is a great place in sydney, playground of the rich and
famous. visit it if you ever visit sydney, tell them i sent you.so lets have a walk through the code, and get a feel for mystical mike, the
man behind the mystic. (do you wear a crazy robe with a hood like a monk
mike?)$ cd codeblue

Now, all this is good for a laugh, but unless its suid, not much use :(CodeBlue will scan apache/squid logfiles looking for code red and nimda log
hits. If it finds a hit, it will connect to the source ip adress of the hit
and send an email warning of infection. Unfortunately, mystical mike was too
far up on his high horse to write something decent.The function that does this is send_email() (line ~552)It starts off like this:int send_email(void)
{
	int sd;
	char *host = malloc(sizeof(char) * 512);/*  .... silly crap using popen and stuff .... */	/* host is the infected host from the logfiles
 	 * this will connect to the host on port 25
	 */    if ((sd = smtp_connect(host)) < SUCCESS)
        return -1;/* Step 0 - Get initial server response */
    get_smtp_reply(sd);/* this is the function of interest *//* line ~345 */
/*********************************************************************
 * fetches a reply from the SMTP server
 */
int get_smtp_reply(int sd)
{
    char response[1024]; /* this is the remote host's mail server buf */	....
    /*
     * We'll loop infinately, receiving
     * 1 byte at a time until we receive a carriage return
     * or line-feed character, signifying the end of the output
     */
	/* GEE! THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA MYSTICAL MIKE#@!#@! */	....    while (TRUE) {
        if (select((sd + 1), &rset, NULL, NULL, &tv) < 0) {
            if (errno != EINPROGRESS) {
                fprintf(stderr, ""[ ERROR: select() failed: %s\n"",
                        strerror(errno));
                return -1;
            }
        }
        if (recv(sd, (int *) &response[i], 1, RECV_FL) < 0) { /* Hello */
            if (errno == EAGAIN) {
                if (elapsed >= smtp_timeout) {
                    fprintf(stderr, ""[ ERROR: operation timed out\n"");
                    fprintf(log, ""..... ERROR: operation timed out\n"");
                    return -1;
                }
                elapsed++;
                usleep(smtp_timeout * 10000);
                continue;
            } else {
                if (!(flags & FL_BEQUIET))
                    fprintf(stderr, ""[ ERROR: recv() failed: %s\n"",
                            strerror(errno));
                fprintf(log, ""..... ERROR: recv() failed: %s\n"",
                        strerror(errno));
                return -1;
            }
        }
        if ((response[i] == '\n')
            || ((response[i] == '\n') && (response[i + 1] == '\n')))
            break;
        i++; /* come here often baby? */
    }So slowly but surely, response is overrun, unless it its a newline.

 * master coder, and here we are now.
 *
 * To use this against a webserver (A) using codeblue.
 *
 * $ printf ""GET /scripts/root.exe\r\n\r\n"" | nc A 80
 *
 * this will add an entry in the access log.
 *
 * ON THE SAME HOST:
 *
 * # ./mystic_anus 25
 *
 * wait a while.
 *
 * when codeblue runs it will pull your ip from the logs, connect to your port
 * 25 and try to send you a mail. because mystic is an idiot, you will get a
 * shell with the openbsd code!!!
 *
 * i like exclamation marks !!!!

I'm a bit confused about this boycott thing.  How is what China is
doing any different than having Scientology and who ever else
state-side who takes the whim evoking the DMCA to close down foreign

2074,"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,781616,00.htmlBritons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in EuropeJohn Carvel, social affairs editor
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The GuardianNot every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According
to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,
shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.
The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of
anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the
University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit
people's shape.
The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the
inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below
the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.
It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)
taller than his French counterpart.
The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men
only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height
advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.
The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared
with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and
1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and
Americans 1,626.7mm
More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other
nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men
and 66.7 for women.
The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7
inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and
806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of
1,047.2mm.
The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second
largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably
smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.
The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than
the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the
Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively
outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.
However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm
compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,
compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.
The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the
available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm
longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American
average.
The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German
counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.
Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for
occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.
The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to
open ring pull cans.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

feeling
by Lester HainesThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has approved a number of new html
'emotitags' which will revolutionise the web surfing experience.The tags have no physical effect, but rather elicit a strong emotional
response from the reader. Top of the list is  (War on TerrorT). The
tag, when judiciously applied, will immediately provoke violent anger
against ragheads, thus:Charity agencies report that Iraqi leader Sadaam Hussein has
adopted the African dictatorial habit of eating his political
opponents.Of particular interest to British code-monkeys is the new  (I'm
hurting too). This is designed for use when reporting on the life of
Elizabeth the Queen Mother and other recently dead famous people:She touched our lives in so many ways with her common touch and her
instinctive understanding of ordinary people. She will be sadly
missed.The instantaneous effect is to reduce the reader to teary-eyed and
self-indulgent wallowing in which he or she becomes unaccountably upset
about the death of a complete stranger.Political reporting also looks to benefit from the new  tag. Any
government ministerial pronouncement is thus rendered immediately
transparent:Tony Blair was quick to defend transport secretary Byers, calling
him ""the most honest man it has been my privilege to know"".And, in a much-needed boost to satire sites, W3C has formally ratified
the controversial . This guarantees any text contained within
it complete immunity from prosecution:Naomi Campbell, we can confirm, is a talentless, drug-addicted
perjurer who believes that good looks alone can justify her appalling
and obnoxious behaviour.The new tags have been warmly received by the programming community. W3C
has, however, warned that they are to be used economically. It has
further cautioned that they should never be used together, since the
effect on the reader could be catastrophic:In response to reports that the Queen Mother had fallen
victim to Sadaam Hussein's Axis of EvilT chemical weapons programme,
Stephen Byers noted: ""She was everybody's favourite grandmother who
touched the lives of billions. The only consolation we can gain from
this tragedy is that all of the UK's trains will be running on time by
next Monday. And you can quote me on that.""http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

achieve.  Remember, also, that the AWL will reduce FPs, but its effects aren't 
factored in to the GA scores.The work currently being done on the GA, and comparing different methods of 
doing the score-setting, is very worthwhile, and extremely useful; however, we 
really ought to get a release out, since 2.31 is getting decreasingly useful as 
time goes on.The FP/FN rate of 2.40 with pretty well *any* score-setting mechanism will be 
better than 2.31 -- we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the 
2.41 or 2.50 branches.DQ> Something like:

DQ>       evolveYou could just allow low and high to be evolved by the GA (within ranges); I'd 
be enormously surprised if it didn't end up with low=-12 and high=+6, since 
that'd give the GA the broadest lattitude in setting individual scores.  The 
issue with fixing low and high is not one of optimization, but rather one of 
human-based concern that individual scores larger than about +4 are dangerous 
and liable to generate FPs, and individual scores less than -8 are dangerous and 
liable to be forged to generate FNs.DQ> Maybe even add a nybias loop.Adding an nybias loop is not worthwhile -- changing nybias scores will just 
alter the evaluation function's idea of what the FP:FN ratio should be.DQ> > AFAIK there's nothing major hanging out waiting to be checked in

about time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles. These things are 
inexorably cyclical. CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world.

devicesâ€? Well, it's crap[2]. There are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS: 
automatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced 
bandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim 
to know a lot about[7]), among others. But â€œbecause it'll future-proof 
your site for the next generation of mobile devicesâ€ is not one of them. 
The theory is solid, but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile 
devices (now that we have them) how it was all supposed to work in practice.

Posted on Thu, Jul. 25, 2002Copyright Law Thwarts Open Source Confab Demo
Posted by Dan Gillmor
Bruce Perens was going to demonstrate a modified DVD player at this week's
Open Source gathering in San Diego. He'd planned to show (Infoworld) how a
DVD player with its regional coding disabled could play DVDs with
different regional codes.Perens was going to do this in violation, he believed, of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, which bans the circumvention of technological
methods to protect copyrighted material from uses the owner doesn't want.
And the possibility of legal trouble led his employer, Hewlett-Packard, to
ask him not to do the demonstration.HP funds Perens to pursue a variety of free software projects. He was
willing to take the legal risks himself, he told me today, but HP worried
that it would be ""a more juicy target,"" the kind of deep pockets that
might make the entertainment cartel drool. In that context it's
understandable why HP would be concerned, though I wish the company would
take a stand on the right side of this issue.So while Perens is going to talk about the DMCA's pernicious impact on
things like free software, he's not going to give his demonstration. A
shame, but that's how things are going these days.Hollywood is winning, folks. You are losing. And you'd better start caringhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

GET WINDOWS XP TIPS: Months after the release of Windows XP Professional and Home editions, people are still learning the nuances of Microsoft's newest operating system. Whether you've been using it for a while or are planning to upgrade to the new OS soon, this ebook is right up your alley. 
GET YOUR COPY 
of Lockergnome's Top 50 Windows XP tips now!    This is of course belated, as I'm sending it on the 18th, but Happy Birthday to Lori!One thing about MacWorld should excite mp3 junkies -- the iPod just got 
even bigger, with a 20GB version and Apple officially endorses Windows 
compatibility. Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions 
came down in price. Hearing that the only ""officially"" functional 
Windows player is MusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my 
opinion. Sure, MusicMatch is a decent player, but with plenty of great 
free players on the market, why do we want to purchase a software 
player in addition to the $299+ hardware unit?At first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true 
Windows compatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional 
functionality, besides song management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's 
XPlay remains a 
better option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an 
iPod with almost any media player made for Windows, it assists with 
contact management, via Outlook vCards, in addition to making the 
iPod an additional drive on your PC. At a mere $10 more than MusicMatch 
Jukebox Plus, XPlay blows the doors off Apple's officially endorsed player.Lori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's 
SIC without a hitch. I just missed a 
face-to-face introduction to John Lal, of 
winferno.com, although I'm sure 
we'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the 
free copy of Research-Desk 
for all Gnomedex attendees. Shortly after arrival, I enjoyed dinner with 
the eSellerate gang, with a 
discussion about GnomeTomes and 
what the future holds.Every time I travel, I'm reminded just how slow dialup really is. Fortunately, my 
Crosspaths.net connection allows me 
to send mail via my Lockergnome account, unlike most of the national dialup 
services. Crosspaths is technically an Iowa ISP, although the have points of 
presence in almost every major city in the country. If you're a dialup user, 
you may want to take a look at their offerings, regardless of where you live. Lori 
has used their DSL service for two years now, and they've been nothing short of 
outstanding in dealing with customer service queries.

Unknown artists across a variety of genres offer free mp3 downloads of 
selected tracks, with an option to purchase songs on CD for the price 
of shipping and handling. All CDs are professionally mastered works, 
so you're getting label quality releases, without the jacked-up retail 
price tag. The mp3s let you decide if the album is worth you $4.95. 
The only thing I find odd about this site is their proclamation of 
paying artists 50% of distribution profits, which I have to assume is 
50% of zero, since the CDs are free. The artist selection contains 
some solid releases by talented artists, regardless.

Click for DetailsWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (NR) 1966
Adapted Play - 131min
Reviewer's Tilt (10)
 Before directing Catch-22 and The Graduate, Mike Nichols made his big screen debut directing this adroit adaptation of Edward Albee's play ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?""  Nominated for thirteen, and winner of five, Academy Awards, this dark tale centers on history professor George (Richard Burton), and his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of the college president.  At first George and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-adjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love.  George and Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs.  Just as quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology professor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise.  Soon Nick and Honey find themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.  Throughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely choreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead, alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.  Thankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost unadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and impeccable timing.  At one point George proposes ""Now that we're through with Humiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how about a little round of Get the Guests?""  This provides some idea of the precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to finish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is Taylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold.  Ok, I will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not have been much of a stretch.  Both actors, however, deliver their lines with the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying slaying.  Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax or look away.   Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is not a ""feel good"" movie. ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is, however, a memorable film that will stick with you for years to come.

5452,"Hello Gary,
Uh, plague is not action.  No, no one has a problem quarantining
someone who has say, Ebola, or malaria, because diseases do not
require any decisive action -- just contact.fantasies, still require decisive action, even if its in conjunction
with the way the fantasy works in the individual's brain. Many people
have very strange and obscure fantasies (say wanting to be a model)
that dont' require them to be locked up.Fantasies aren't nearly as much like plagues.   Not everyone in a
given population necessarily adheres to that given fantasy, whereas
everyone can get a given plague.   (BTW, gary, the whole concept of
monitoring a given 'racial populaiton' for fear of them getting a
plague is silly.  I don't think plagues discriminate)You're trying to argue for a lock'em all up mentality, when I don't
think anyone but you has even mentioned it.   His point was that
fantaesies were a psychological? explanation for a possible event.
Not that all people who have them, or even have a certain type, need
to be locked up, quarantined, killed, rubbed-out or cleansed.GLM> Well, for example ..>>>>>> ""b"" == bitbitch   writes:GLM>     b> Once we understand this [ the fantasy virus model ], many of

2125,"Evening Standard - 28 August 2002[Deft use of Fortean Unit of Measurement in 2nd para - MA] 'Lost' penguins found alive
 
 by Charles Miranda A colony of emperor penguins which was thought to have starved to death in
 Antarctica has been found alive in a ""big huddle"".  The birds were spotted by the crew of a USAF jet returning to base in New
 Zealand. Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica
 had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. 
 
 Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made
 it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in
 October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: ""The
 penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a
 successful breeding season over the winter."" 
 
 Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall
 and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research
 station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the
 cape, may have lost up to third of its population.

In my experience Windows will change the hardware clock the first time
you boot into it after the clocks have gone forward/back an hour.  This
will only happen twice a year. How to stop it, I have not checked (I
just switch the clock back an hour from within windows after such a
reboot).  Is there a GMT windows timezone?With ntp, it is a big no-no (afaik) to have other programs messing with
the clock as it will put ntp's calculations of drift etc., out. (maybe
this only applies to chrony, which is what I use).  If the windows
change only moves forward an hour, and you shift back an hour, maybe ntp
will be (relatively) ok (depends if all the remaining digits of time
precision are left unchanged, probably they aren't exactly).

Here's the better idea. Invite her for an afternoon
cruise under the Golden Gate bridge in your Stonehorse
day sailor. Under way, ask her if she'd like to take
the stick. Back at slip, cook her dinner. Something
simple, but good, maybe a stir fry or a stew, served
in the cockpit, with an inexpensive but potable wine.If she runs away after that, 'tis good riddance. If
she wants to try it again, another day, she shows
promise. If she asks you to show her the V berth, you
have a girlfriend. If she notes your brightwork needs
another coat, and asks what you're using on it,
propose on the spot.;-)

 Dear Readers,Your ISP, if it's anything like mine, works like a very large
boat: It moves slowly, it turns slowly, and sometimes it leaks.
Take rogue wireless networks, for example. For many months now,
some mischievous entrepreneurs have been hacking into major ISP
networks and siphoning off bandwidth for neighborhood wireless
networks. Only now, months later, are broadband bigwigs doing
something about it. And what
about ISP hackers? Could they break into your service provider?
Probably. Thankfully, you can protect yourself against most of
these leaks. Let Dan Tynan, our ISP guru, show you how. Quick links to Services & Prices from these companies

4983,"Thanks that helps.  There's still so little info on TES and those of us
here since RazorV1 know how it works.  I did set my min_cf to ""ac-100""
which I thought would be zero.  So the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a
trust level of 1 and have to work their way up.  Your trust level
increases when someone nominates the same message as spam. This must
have been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the
changes dumped everyone's trust level.  Now here come the questions...What engine signature does TES look at?  Does it have to be the same e1
signature or does it use the e2 or e4 signatures.  How many people have
to nominate the message before everyones rating increases?  How many
revokes decreases someones rating?  Does a single revoke decrease the
rating of everyone that nominated the message?  If a newby reports a
message that has already been reported does their trust level
immediately go up?  In the case of revoking, does someone with a trust
level of 1 have the capability to revoke a message submitted by multiple
people with higher trust levels?

Subject: Re: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now?
Bobby, Couple of things: If you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an
immediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the
confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam.
This might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users
grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become
shorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their
legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting.Also, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in
razor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended
average confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should
return true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a
trusted user).apt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a
_maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate.cheers,
vipul.

It is actually a lot worse than this.  What it boils down to is that
only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company. 
What I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively
still exists (literally the same families), but they now hold top
executive and management positions in the major French firms and the
government, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not
officially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws
and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. 
Even for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them
from branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many
can leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about
the French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about
it (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect
this may hold true for other European countries as well.  After all those ""revolutions"", France is still nothing more than a
thinly veiled old-school aristocracy, with all the trappings.-James Rogers

option, one I hadn't seen much of, before.  Look as if OnStream (spun
off from Philips Electronics in 1998) invented and rather tightly
control the format, though other companies such as Verbatim do make
compatible media under licence.If you're reasonably serious about backup, you need to plan for a
rotational backup scheme and retirement of tapes as they become worn
(and well before they start failing).  That requires at least a couple
of dozen tapes for the first couple of years.  Therefore, cost and
availability of media are (or should be) a major factor.  Also, tape
heads wear out and need to be replaced (more rapidly for helical-scan
systems -- which ADR turns out _not_ to be), and somehow that always
ends up being cheaper for tape technologies in which there is heavy
competition.The less-tangible consideration that comes most immediately to mind is
that, if one's OnStream ADR drive fails, the only possible replacement
that would suffice to restore your accumulated backup sets is another 
OnStream ADR drive.  In that sense, you're somewhat locked in:  I'm 
not seeing ADR drives from anyone else (though I might have missed
them).  If OnStream are smart, they've priced the drives to attract people into
the system, and are making up the shortfall on media cost after they 
get people to buy in.   I see the following prices for mail order 
(http://www.finnsoft.com/priclist/verbat.htm) of Verbatim-brand tapes:42 euros for 30 GB ADR tape
33 euros for 30 GB ADR tape, four-pack.
66 euros for 50 GB ADR tape.
44 euros for 50 GB ADR tape, four-pack.
47 euros for ADR cleaning tape.(You don't get much lower pricing than Verbatim, without going no-name.)Capacities are usually quoted on the basis of a nominal 2:1 compression
ratio.  The PDF datasheet for Onstream's ""ADR2"" series says this is a
linear-serpentine recording technology (a good thing) like DLT, SDLT,
and LTO, rather than a helical-scan method typified by DDS/DAT, AIT, and
8mm (which puts heavy wear on tapes on heads).I'm not sure what software other than NovaStor's TapeCopy and Yosemite
Technology's Tapeware will support OnStream's drives.  My recollection
is that BRU will do it.On balance, I'd personally _still_ go with a DDS4 drive using either DDS3
or DDS4 media, mostly because once you've survived life with one
oddball, less-standard tape format, you're not in a hurry to repeat the
experience.  But ADR does seem at a quick glance to be well designed,
and might be a good bet after all.  As they say in the gaming industry,
""Ya pays your money, and ya takes your chances.""--

The ""other stuff"" is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff.
This is why MS is hunting people with illegal Windows; it's no harder
to dup than a Linux CD, only what is there that actually prevents
people from doing it?Personally, I don't think the issue should have anything to do with
sales or units.  The issue is that basic phallacy that says a suit
should be able to ""own"" someone else's intellectual property.  Sarah
McLaughlin isn't suing you, it's her label's legal dept because it's
the label who stands to lose; Sarah's already fat beyond her wildest
dreams, so a few bucks here or there, or even if the well dried up
tomorrow, it's not going to really traumatize her (unless she's been
blazingly stupid with her money)But the label ... like Disney and Mickey, they need the cash cow so
they can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers-on in limos and coke.
If you thought only Elvis or Brian Jones or Dennis Wilson had problems
with beautiful-people deadbeat leech ""friends"" draining their riches,
think again.The problem is really very simple because it is semantic, and until we
make the semantic flip, it's unsolvable, but like trisecting an angle,
all it takes is looking at the same situation in a different
way.  Here's the revelation: Elvis never ever made a hit record.Elvis didn't make the hits, his /fans/ made the hits.  His fans did
the work cleaning toilets, manning the convenience stores, driving
milk trucks, sitting at endless office desks, they did the /real/
labour that paid for every last one of Elvis Presley's pills.  All
Elvis did was sing into a microphone every so often, and pen or
collect the odd song that all those /people/ liked and wanted as
something of their own.  But it's not _Elvis_ who made them universal
statements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs into
their own lives, it was pull-technology, not push.Therefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans pay
before they own what they themselves have created?  They pay royalties
for listening to the radio, for blank tapes, for concert tickets, for
a beer in a bar with a cover band ... they pay over and over and over
again for the /right/ to make some hack writer's song /their/
favourite song????  That's where the whole system has been seriously
warped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into your
thinking that it is the Elvis who makes the Elvis.  It's not.  It's
the people who make them; the songs are already theirs.--

Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?Enough.If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.This business is done completely by internet and email, and you

insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still

Date: Not suppliedAfter the talk at UT Austin, I spent Saturday at the Turkey City science 
fiction writers' workshop at Bruce Sterling's place. Turkey City is a venerable 
science fiction workshop that has spawned many good writers and a lexicon of 
science fiction critical terms that is the de facto standard for understanding 
what works and what doesn't in a work of science fiction:     Squid on the Mantelpiece     Chekhov said that if there are dueling pistols over the mantelpiece in the 
    first act, they should be fired in the third. In other words, a plot 
    element should be deployed in a timely fashion and with proper dramatic 
    emphasis. However, in SF plotting the MacGuffins are often so overwhelming 
    that they cause conventional plot structures to collapse. It's hard to 
    properly dramatize, say, the domestic effects of Dad's bank overdraft when 
    a giant writhing kraken is levelling the city. This mismatch between the 
    conventional dramatic proprieties and SF's extreme, grotesque, or visionary 
    thematics is known as the ""squid on the mantelpiece.""     Card Tricks in the Dark     Elaborately contrived plot which arrives at (a) the punchline of a private 
    joke no reader will get or (b) the display of some bit of learned trivia 
    relevant only to the author. This stunt may be intensely ingenious, and 
    very gratifying to the author, but it serves no visible fictional purpose. 
    (Attr. Tim Powers) I had the cold from hell all weekend and I'm jetlagged, but I wanted to get 
some links up before I hit the sack. Until tomorrow! Link[1] Discuss[2][1] http://www.sfwa.org/writing/turkeycity.html

  | Um, my test was to tee to a fifo I didn't read from... resulting
  | in the other reader hanging around forever.... not realising that
  | never-opened-for-reading and opened-and-later-closed might be
  | different. ah!  yes!  this is one of those gotchas everyone stumbles
 over.  the writer of a never-opened-for-reading pipe will
 quickly block (as soon as the pipe's limited buffer fills
 up).  but the writer of opened-and-later-closed pipe gets
 an EPIPE error (and the usually-terminal SIGPIPE signal). the typical stumble is someone creates an anonymous pipe
 with pipe(2), but forgets to close(2) the reader's fd in
 the writer-process (or visa-versa) .... and then wonders
 why the real reader never sees an EOF and/or the writer
 is never gets an EPIPE/SIGPIPE.  various FAQs and many
 books probably discuss this topic in depth to the death.  |             Sensible behaviour has now been observed. good!  and good luck.
cheers,

Lagos-Nigeria.For your kind attention,
              REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.  However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Compan!
y.Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.
Yours FaithfullyBARRISTER ADEWALE COKER.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

2376,"I recently stumbled across the contents of the journal, ""Electronic
Publishing"", which was published from January, 1988 through December, 1995.
All papers are available online in PDF (this was apparently one of the first
journals to disseminate in PDF, in 1994). The journal also reprints some of
the better papers from the Electronic Publishing conferences, held bi-yearly
from 1986-1992 (EP86, EP88, EP90, EP92).http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/epoddtoc.htmlToday's reader might look at the contents and wonder about their relevance,
since they don't directly discuss the Web. As an academic, I find this
journal valuable, since the papers are of generally high quality (by top
researchers), and they provide lots of pointers to the evolution of the
ideas that led to many Web technologies.  It's one source among many for
sifting through the intellectual lineage of electronic publishing
technologies.Rohit and Adam might find the following papers especially relevant, in the
context of their WWW7 ""Evolution of Document Species"" paper:Page Description Languages: Development, Implementation and Standardization:

Brooklyn Bridge for sale! No kidding! The town of Brooklyn, 
Iowa has a bridge that they are selling on Ebay, so if you have a need for such 
a structure, or just want to have the right to say you 
legitimately purchased the Brooklyn Bridge, here's your 
opportunity! Seriously, this is not a prank!Ever since I was down toward Des Moines last week and had 
a cup-o-java with Jake at Starbucks, I've been craving 
coffee. I can't see myself turning into a coffee junkie like 
Chris, but it's just weird that this would happen, being 
that my extent of coffee drinking has usually been limited 
to the severe need for a quick morning wake-up or in an 
effort to keep warm on cold mornings when out in the field 
back in my Marine Corps days. As time has gone on, I've been trying to cut back on the 
typical geek vices of sugar and caffeine, but I can't drink 
coffee straight. It has to be sweet, and what's the point of 
drinking coffee if there's no caffeine? Enter Splenda. An 
artificial sweetener that has finally made it to Waterloo, 
Iowa. Most of what Diana and I use sugar for has been 
modified to use Splenda instead, with good results. 
Hopefully this coffee thing is just a temporary kick like it 
usually is. I have to brush my teeth after a cup or two from 
the nasty breath. It's fun to test out the dragon-breath on 
the cat to see just how bad it really is. If Bootes sniffs a 
couple of times, it's not too bad, but if she instantly 
recoils, time to employ the Sonicare for a couple of 
minutes. See what you've started, Jake?See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK
Exchange Titanium Details Emerge
http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/07-15exchangeqa.asp
Oracle recently announced their intention to compete 
directly with Microsoft Exchange, even accepting Outlook as 
an email client. In what seems like a direct response, we're 
handed details of the 2003 release of Exchange Titanium. 
I've always liked what Exchange can do, so I'm certainly 
looking forward to seeing what the new features will be all 
about, but I'm also interested in what Oracle will be 
bringing to the table. Better email functionality, control 
and security are the name of the game, whoever ends up being 
the vendor of choice. Included in this Q&A is a screenshot 
of what Outlook may look like once Office 11 is released. 
It's an interesting concept shot, showing some new ways they 
plan to handle email views. It doesn't say anything for 
Exchange functionality, but it's worth noting regardless.

Better Pocket PC Audio

cool! I like what they're working on here. I decided to wipe 
out my Jornada yesterday, so I haven't done a direct 
comparison between the iPaq 3870 and Jornada 565 for audio 
quality using this player, which has an equalizer built-in, 
but it definitely has potential judging from how it sounds 
on the iPaq right out of the gate. Definitely give this a 
peek if you're one of those that likes to play audio and 
video on a Pocket PC. Quite a few different versions are 
supported, so you should be able to find something 
appropriate to your device.

http://news.com.com/2100-1001-944053.html
Three readers asked me about this very thing this week, 
and it's something you should probably know about if you use 
Windows XP. Microsoft didn't bundle the Java Virtual Machine 
with Windows XP, and since the release of XP, the JVM has been avaialble via the 
Windows Update site as a ""convenience"" to users. Part of Sun's legal
complaints surrounding how Microsoft has handled Java was that Microsoft did not have the right to 
distribute their implementation via the web, though 
they did have licensing rights to include it with Windows. 
So essentially, Microsoft has things backwards, as it seems. 
Well, to avoid further web distribution arguments, Microsoft 
has yanked the JVM from the Windows Update site and all 
other areas of Microsoft's web site. Microsoft is still 
planning to include Java with Windows XP Service Pack 1. 
You'll have to plan for Java support accordingly, as SP1 is 
still a ways off and you can't get it from Microsoft at this 
point. If you need it for a new installation of Windows XP 
in the short term, Sun will gladly provide you with their 
own distibution.

Another Xeon Deal
Served up by Warren Dugashttp://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?sku=C170-1032%20P
I mentioned a really nice deal on Compaq Evo W6000 dual-
Xeon workstations a few weeks back, which I know several of 
you took advantage of, but the $1999 price tag likely scared 
off many others. If you still want to get into a Xeon, check 
this one out. TigerDirect is offering an Evo W8000 
workstation with a single 1.7GHz processor, 18.2GB 15,000rpm U160 
drive, 48x CD-ROM and licenses for both Windows 2000 Pro and 
NT 4.0 Workstation for $699.99. Note that there is NO memory 
and no video card included, so you'll have to scrounge those for 
yourself, but it really is a pretty good deal, on the whole. 
Also realize that these systems take RAMBUS memory, which 
will add a bit of cost, so be sure you know what you're 
getting - a wicked-fast workstation, to be sure! Expandability is also quite amazing with these machines. Recommend It!http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/techspecialist/20020717.html

  Test the hub ports by switching cables around.
  Run ifconfig on the server - any errors and what kind they are.
  Test the network card... by replacing the thing!Seriously, if the server has a PCI slot free, something like a Realtek 8139
based card costs less than 20 euro.  The design is a couple of generations later
- more memory, less cruft, no *FSCKING* dos config utility, no jumpers on the
card and it's PCI.  Ronan.

----------------------------------------------------------------It does, but it's not the cost that is causing us to shut it down. The cost
is a ""minimum $500 per year""... but that only accounts for 18 people
streaming and playing like 13 or 14 songs an hour. But we could maybe manage
the 2 cents per person, per 100 songs.The problem comes with the record keeping they mandate with webstreaming.
Start and end times for every song (not too hard), artist (okay), title
(okay), composers (a little harder), serial number (wtf??). I think there
are a few more things they wanted, but honestly, programming this info in
for every song that we play is ridiculous. This means we'd also have to get
all the DJs to find this info and write it down any time they play a
request, vinyl, or CDs not loaded into the computer. It's ridiculous and
nearly impossible...We would need someone to sit in the studio 24/7 writing down all this info -
which sometimes isn't available, like from earlier album that don't have
serial numbers and barcodes. Then still if only the magic 18 people
webstream our signal, the price would become quite exponential since we play
on average 16 songs an hour, we'd be paying $22.11 everyday to stream to
those 18 people. So really, it does have to do with the internet tax, but it
is a few reasons together why we can't do it after their kill-date. :(

changed a kernel or something. Matthias has made this a thing of the past! Dude,
it's a no brainer, use apt-get or just download and install.What's more, OSS is fully ""imitated"", older apps using OSS are as happy as a clam.
My personal taste tells me newer apps which use alsa sound better (alsaplayer, xmms
with alsa module) to my ear.The 2 things that trick people are the modules.conf file, they didn't have that
automatic matrix page when I started with alsa, you don't know how good you have it.And on my old installs (only the first time I installed it on a clean box), alsa
always was ""muted"" until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music. It's possible
Matthias even took care of that too. Anyway it is/was only a one time thing on 1st
install, that was a long time ago for me.Those ALSA dudes had been trying to get it into the 2.4 kernel but missed it, but
it's been in 2.5 for a while now, so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel.--

'Received' header, and the second counts msgs that had 7 instances.  I
expect this is a good clue!  The more indirect the mail path, the more of
those thingies we'll see, and if you're posting from a spam trailer park in

It's plausible that case is significant, if, e.g., a particular spam mailing

misconfigures his package.>  0.02    65  3559 'header:Precedence:1'

will tell you roughly how much traffic is going through with access,

 | Read Full Story Microsoft unbundles directory technologyMicrosoft will begin selling its directory technology as a standalone product separate from the Windows operating system.
Microsoft will continue to build in its ""Active Directory"" as part of Windows, but will give its customers the new option of buying the technology as a separate product next year, Microsoft executives said this week.

Another problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN, USB modem ( LASAT Speed Basic ), however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux, but again it is featured in the Hardware Browser, without installed drivers.Thanks for your replies.... However i still cant get it to detect the External USB modem. I also have an internal 56k fax modem, but i cannot get that detected either ( maybe its because it was designed for Windows and is not supported ). Im not going to buy a new modem ( I think 2 is more than enough for 1 PC ).It could well be my inexperience with Linux that is making this more difficult, but whatever it is iv just about had enough!! Any last gasp ideas would be welcomeMany ThanksMark--

completely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to
see. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for
themselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller.Contrast this with TeS which utilizes ""sooper secret"" methodologies to
determine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point
something becomes spam at some level of ""confidence.""The unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly
ineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I've done indicates about
a 40% hit rate. Submissions I made a week ago still don't count as spam,
apparently because I'm not trusted enough, or enough people haven't submitted
the item, or some unknown combination thereof. Why anyone would continue to
waste their time submitting items when they aren't being accepted due to
a series of calculations which will not be shared is beyond me.Any trust model that cannot survive public scrutiny isn't worth trusting IMHO./\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

even be partitioned into manageable steps. All this can also be done
without selling exclusive rights to your wallet to the World's

* Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 Imminent
* Thinking in C++, Volume 2, Revision 6 Available
* Thinking in Java Hands-on Seminar, Bay Area, November
* Java2 Enterprise Programming Seminar, Bay Area, November
* New seminars
* Limited Number of Signed Copies of TIJ2 for saleSee the Calendar for the current schedule:
http://www.mindview.net/Calendar===================================
* Come work on Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, in Crested ButteAll but one of the Interns has departed (he's staying through
December) and we have empty rooms in the condo that I rented in Mt.
Crested Butte for the Interns to stay in. If you'd like to
volunteer to come up (Crested Butte is gorgeous in late
Summer/early Fall, with excellent hiking and mountain biking), stay
in the condo, and help work on the 3rd edition of Thinking in Java,
please email Sharlynn@Mindview.net with your resume and
availability dates (note that the book is due at the end of
October). There will be a technical and writing test, and
interviews to reveal how well you self-motivate and work with
others.This should be a great learning experience and a fun time.===================================
* Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 ImminentThe second revision will be up on the site soon, at:
http://64.78.49.204/The biggest change is that I've rewritten significant part of the
multithreading chapter (although it still has a ways to go). The
goal is to rewrite the chapter to introduce the essence of
threading with simplicity, and without GUI examples (this
simplifies things, and allows threads to appear before GUIs).The chapters have also been reorganized into something like their
final form, although the final chapter numbering hasn't been done
yet. We have made more progress in the testing system.Other details of the changes made in the new version will be at the
beginning of the book.The book is due at the end of October. The print version will
appear in December.===================================
* Thinking in C++, Volume 2, Revision 9 Available tomorrowAvailable at:
http://64.78.49.204/Chapters 1-4 are finished===================================
* Thinking in Java Hands-on Seminar
November 4th-8th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.
Registration opens on September 4th.
http://www.mindview.net/Seminars/ThinkingInJava/Created by Bruce Eckel, taught by Andrea Provaglio. We believe this
is the best in-depth introduction to Java that you'll find.  It's
based on the book ""Thinking in Java,"" which was created as the
seminar evolved.Please note the early registration discount: 
* $1,600 for payments received by October 12th
* $1,950 for payments received after October 12th===================================
* Java2 Enterprise Programming Seminar
November 18th-22th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.
Registration opens on September 4th.
http://www.mindview.net/Seminars/J2EE/Created and taught by Andrea Provaglio, this seminar introduces you
to the practical development of real-world, Web-enabled,
distributed applications with Java. It covers J2EE and its key
technologies: Enterprise JavaBeans, Servlets, Java ServerPages, and
the basic architectural patterns used to combine these technologies
into maintainable applications. Andrea has been teaching this course in the US and in Europe for
the last two years, and he has recently restructured and updated
the seminar to include the latest J2EE features.You'll come out of this course with a comprehensive understanding
of the J2EE architecture, of the problems that it is designed to
solve, how to select the most appropriate tools, and how to code
your solutions.Please note the early registration discount: 
* $1,700 for payments received by October 26th
* $2,300 for payments received after October 26th===================================
* New seminarsBill Venners and I just finished giving the last ""Objects &
Patterns"" seminar, and everyone (especially us) had a great time.We are now beginning to work towards the two new seminars spawned
by Objects & Patterns, which Bill and I plan to teach together:
Design Patterns in Java
(Drawing primarily from ""Thinking in Patterns"")Designing Objects & Systems
This will include a lot of material from Bill's upcoming book on
Object Design, along with coverage of UML, XP, Object-Oriented
Design techniques and guidelines, and of course exercises and
projects.We hope to begin teaching the courses early next year. Stay tuned.===================================
* Limited Number of Signed Copies of TIJ2 for saleI'm selling the last 17 of my author copies of Thinking in Java,
2nd edition. I've signed each one and drawn a little cartoon with
the signature (the books are in La Mesa, and I'm in Crested Butte,
so unfortunately I can't personalize them). The cost in the USA is
$40, which includes handling and mailing. Outside the USA, you'll
have to email to the address below to find out the additional
shipping cost.To order, divide your credit card number (Visa, MC, Amex) into two
different emails (not high security, but highly likely to be safe),
and include your credit card billing address and expiration date.
Email your order to:
Wayne@MindView.net
Wayne will email you back to clarify any necessary details.

Subject: NEWS: GNU/DEVELOPMENT... intl orgns take a close look at GNU/Linux
Date: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:42 GMTGNU/DEVELOPMENT, INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT GNU/LINUX>From Frederick NoronhaINDIA: There's good news round the corner -- international organisations and
prominent networks worldwide are waking up to the rich potential of
Free/Open Source Software, a field that is slowly being recognised for the
immense promise it holds out to the Third World.But can this be tapped speedily enough and effectively? >From the Unesco to the World Bank, and other global organisations, all are
catching up on the potential of using GNU/Linux as a potent tool in working
towards development. More so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial
office suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's
earnings.United Nation's Development Programme's Ms. Radhika Lal
, a Information-Communication Technology Policy
Advisor, recently drew attention to a conference on Open Source for
E-Government. It is to be held in Washington, DC on October 17-18.infoDev, the Cyberspace Policy Institute of The George Washington
University, and the UNDP are jointly behind this event. It is intended to
draw participants from local, national and international organizations from
both the public and private sector.This meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness
about the potential of open source and free software for e-governance. More
importantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors,
users and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in Open Source,
e-Government and related fields.Ms Lal works at the ICT-for-Development's Special Initiative Bureau for
Development Policy at the UNDP's East 45th Street offices in New York.ICT-for-development is a campaign to use more of infotech and the Internet
for global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy.
But despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the GNU/Linux world,
so far little networking has been done between these two separate circles.See http://www.egovos.org/OTHER ARMS OF THE U.N.
======================Besides, the UNDP, other arms of the United Nations are also known to be
showing increasing interest in the potential of free software/open source
tools. Paris-headquartered Unesco (United Nations Education, Scientific and
Cultural Organisation) recently launched its own Free Software portal. It's at http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft.UNESCO's Jean-Claude Dauphin  of the Information
Society Division also announced that this international organisation has
been looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the Free Software
movement in relation with UNESCO fields of competence -- education, science
and culture.It zeroed in particularly on those coming from the Third World (also called
the 'South' countries) who could could make propositions for ""revising,
updating and extending the UNESCO Free Software Portal"" as well as for
including new basic documents. ""This work could be done using a fee or consultant contract and the fee can
be discussed depending on the amount of work described in the contract,""
said Dauphin. Check out the sites atUNESCO Libraries Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_bib/)
UNESCO Archives Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_archives/)
UNESCO Free Software Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft/)
UNESCO Observatory on the Information Society (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/observatory/)NEW TOOLS FOR CDS/ISIS
======================Recently, Unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange
from and to its CDS/ISIS software. These two new tools -- ImpExp2709 and
IsisAscii v 0.92 -- have recently been released for data exchange from and
to UNESCO's software package CDS/ISIS. CDS/ISIS is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is
freely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within
the Third World. The new utilities have been released with their source code
(GPL license). See http://www.unesco.org/webworld/news/2002/020806_isis.shtmlMeanwhile, UNDP's APDIP (Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme)
based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously
about organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, GNU/Linux and
related issues.""We want to see how we can further this cause in the region,"" APDIP's Shahid
Akhtar told this correspondent.Niranjan Rajani , of Pakistani origin but based
in the birthplace of Linux, Finland, is now working on a research project on
""Significance of Free/OpenSource Software for Developing Countries"".This project is financed by the Finnish Foreign Ministry, and he has
undertaken to write the paper by the end of November this year, for
Maailma.Net, a local division of OneWorld.Net.This project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use
of FS/OSS, especially some of its most significant and popular projects;
GNU/Linux, Apache, Mozilla, OpenOffice etc. in the developing or Third World
countries. It will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies
and lives of these countries.CONVINCING GOVERNMENTS
======================In India, organisations like Red Hat have been putting out slick
presentations to convince governments and officials to try out Open Source. Shift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. That's
the message that governments across India were recently with, as official
computerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and
speedy software-fuelled hardware obsolence.Senior IT and e-governance officials from across the country tuned in
attentively during a recent seminar in Goa, as executives from computing
giant IBM and leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India narrated long
lists of benefits that governments could get from going the Linux way.Pointing to examples from across the globe, Red Hat India argued that the US
Department of Energy has built supercomputers on GNU/Linux, the Chinese are
making Linux the official server operating system -- to be widely used in
varsities, military installations and within government. Some months back, an organisation under India's Ministry of Information
Technology -- called the ER&DCI (Electronics Research and Development Centre
of India) -- entered into a strategic alliance with leading Linux systems
supplier Red Hat India to popularize the 'open source' solution in the
government sector.On networks like the EDC/World Bank-support GKD (Global Knowledge for
Development), issues of free software and open source often make it to the
news.GNU/Linux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed
out. (See http://www.lincproject.org)""The Low Income Networking and Communication (LINC) Project of the Welfare
Law Center has helped many low-income led organizing groups acquire access
to the Internet and use technology more effectively,"" says Dirk Slater
. While these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one
another and their allies by using the Internet, one communication hurdle
remains -- communicating with their leadership via the Internet. Despite many ""digital divide"" initiatives addressing access to the Internet
in low-income communities, access is still an issue. Public Internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not
sufficient, as Slater has pointed out. Many low-income leaders do not have
access to the Internet where it would make the most impact -- in their
homes. LINC argues that the need for Internet communication is particularly great
for rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent
face-to-face meetings because of distance, time and money constraints.""We began to explore the idea of using Linux, a free operating system that
works well on older computers, when we learned of Microsoft's decision to
discontinue support of its older operating systems like Windows 95<
according to Slater, who is 'senior circuit rider' for the Low-Income
Networking and Communications (LINC) Project at the Welfare Law Center.LINC protagonists say they had also been ""troubled"" by the frequent problems
that occur for Windows users just by having Windows run on its own. ""Giving
a person who lives in a rural area an older computer with Windows seemed
like we were just asking for trouble. We also attempted to identify similar
projects but had limited success,"" says Slater. LINC wanted to increase its ability to provide stable desktop systems using
donated computers for board members and leaders of low-income led
organizations that LINC serves. ""Our goal is to increase the ability of LINC Project partner groups to use
open-source software to support their organizing work. We also wanted to
document the project as much as we possibly could, so we could provide
details of our experiences for others doing similar projects,"" LINC
explains.LINC identified a partner in Grass Roots Organizing in Mexico, MO, and
installed GNU/Linux on 10 computers used as stand-alone workstations in
people's homes. GNU/Linux was also installed on a brand new stand-alone
computer to work as the main computer in the GRO office.Links were built with the Mizzou Linux Users Group for ongoing local
support.""We still have a long way to go before we can call this a completely
successful project. After a period of a few months we will assess whether
the board members are actually using the computers to communicate more
effectively,"" said Slater.To view the daily journals on the project with GRO please visit the LINC
Project Linux pages at NEED TO NETWORK
===============Bala Pillai , who was earlier based in Malaysia and now in
Sydney-Australia, is founder of Tamil Innaiyam (http://www.tamil.net), an
organisation to promote the Tamil language worldwide. He points to the
impact GNU/Linux is making in some distant areas of the Third World.Says Pillai: ""The most interactive open source/Linux community in our time
zone/Asia springs out of the Philippines. Primarily because the Filipino
psyche is a more secure psyche, a more self-confident psyche. ""Folks who are self-confident worry about the future less, and allocate more
time diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and re-echoing it.
Filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing -- we should look to
more symbiosis with them,"" says he. Pillai also notes that the Manila-based Miguel Paraz, whom he interacted
with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the Filipino Linux community.
""http://www.q-linux.com is a good starting point to get a feel for the key
Open Source catalysts in the Philippines,"" says he. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based Dinesh who runs http://www.alphaque.com is
another lead Open Source catalyst from the region, explains Pillai. ""Do look
for symbiosis opportunities there too,"" he suggests. ""I see lots of room for us to symbiosis together. For example, there is
likely to be areas where we diagnosing, documenting, analyzing, coding or
publicizing where there is over-duplication. If we coordinated ourselves and
found out where our circles and priorities intersect , we could share this
work and get fruits out faster,"" he adds.

Subject: Attn programmers: support offered [FLOSS-Sarai Initiative]
Date: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:45 GMTDear friends,Can we manage to get some money into backing Free/Libre Open Source
Software initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to
support their cash-strapped initiatives? Sarai.net, a Delhi-based initiative under the CSDS (Centre for the Study
of Developing Societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea.Jeebesh Bagchi  sent in this offer recently. It could
surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to
make a break in Free Software/Open Source, but hamstrung by resources. It might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely 
workable, I guess. This is my own gut-level feeling, but maybe bigger
initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. If
such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for
greater support to free software/open source developers in regions like
ours. --FN
========== Forwarded message ==========The Sarai Programme, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi
(www.sarai.net) invites applications for Support Grants to projects in the

CUT YOUR DESIGN COSTS AND TIME: Get access to 250+ Web Templates 
with CSS at BasicTemplates.com. 
Annual memberships are only $54.95. Individual templates are $5.00 each. 
New templates added weekly. No link back is required, and web designers 
are not charged higher fees to use them on their clients' sites. 
Browse the full gallery!   Somehow, it never got mentioned that Lockergnome has a GnomeTome for all 
you 
Dreamweaver users out there. Dennis Jarrett, a gnomie from the UK 
with a prolific list of writing accomplishments, lent his brain to a list 
of things everyone should know to make using Dreamweaver 4 (and newer) 
easier to use. I 've never actually used version 4, having stuck with 3 
until recently starting the review process of the StudioMX  suite, but 
I've been  able to apply every tip I tried to some aspect of DreamweaverMX, 
so I can only guess those of you using 4 will want to 
check 'em out too.As I mentioned in yesterday's Digital Media newsletter, I recently 
switched cell phones to the 
Kyocera QCP6035. 
The unit is Palm powered, with a screen the size of an m105 and all the 
functionality of Palm OS, in addition to having the latest bells and whistles 
you'd want in a phone. Built in Web browsing, by way of MSN, is slightly 
cumbersome compared to what I'm used to from my cable connection, but I can 
already see the usefulness in carrying around portable access to things like 
driving directions. Now that I've got a way to test the final results in real time, I've got a 
more vested interest in making Lockergnome considerably more WAP compatible. 
I'm still figuring out many of the phone's features, so that's still going to 
be at least  a few weeks away. Without a doubt, I'll be sharing my experiences 
in WAPing Lockergnome in an upcoming series of articles.Jake LudingtonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeMAIL
phpMyNewsletter
http://gregory.kokanosky.free.fr/phpmynewsletter/As a free solution for managing newsletters, for smaller lists, 
this does most of what you need. Subscribers are stored in a 
mySQL database, with the ability to send user confirmation 
e-mails. Initially, the address must still be added manually to 
the database, which isn't idea, but doing this generates a 
confirmation e-mail with a link that users click on if they want 
to be added. The software purges addresses with no response, 
following an administrator defined waiting period. From the php 
interface you can send either text or HTML formatted messages, 
with a built-in preview to make sure your formatting is OK. 
Documentation is somewhat sparse, so prior knowledge of php and 
mySQL are useful in getting this installed.Â GnomeTOOLSOpalisRobot v4.0 [60MB] NT/W2k/XP
http://www.opalis.comThink of this as something like ""cron for Windows"" only even more powerful. 
OpalisRobot allows you to schedule almost any process on your server, 
adding an additional layer of functionality, like the ability to program 
telephony commands to complete administrative tasks. OpalisRobot 
effectively processes e-mail commands, in addition to telephone DTMF tones, 
making everything on your server administerable from remote locations, 
even when you can't get remote control access of the machine. Programming 
jobs is point-click simple, saving you time even when you schedule tasks 
to save you time. If you operate in a Windows server environment, you're 
adding extra hours to your day and costing your company additional dollars 
by not having this software.Â GnomeSERVER
PNG Files Do Not Show Transparency in Internet Explorer (Q294714)
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q294714""If you browse to a Web page that contains an image that has a transparent 
background in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, the image background 
may appear to be gray rather than transparent.""Fortunately, Microsoft explains a solution for this problem. Personally, I 
haven't encountered this PNG display error, but for those of you 
simplementing PNGs on your sites, you'll want to review the solution.WEB TEMPLATES WITH CSS: Cut your design costs and time with an 
annual membership from BasicTemplates.com. 
For only $54.95 get access to 250+ Web Templates. 
New templates added weekly.  
Â GnomeUSABILITYhttp://diveintomark.org/Not only is this information great for improving blog accessibility, it 
happens to be equally relevant for *any* site. The 30 days are nearing 
their end, which means you won't have to wait to find out what's next; 
you can simply click to the next page. Mark Pilgrim, the site's creator, 
sets the stage with 5 characters (all of which could easily represent 
real people) and walks through their physical, mental, and technological 
limitations. Following the character introductions, Mark walks through 
an accessibility scenario each day and then relates the concept back 
specific benefits for each character's limitations. Solutions are 
presented with blogs in mind, but with very little extrapolation you'll 
be able to make every site you design more user friendly.
Â GnomeBLOG
Backend.UserLand.Com
http://backend.userland.com/I've been using Radio from the moment I finally got around to creating 
a blog. The software keeps things simple and automatically updates 
itself when new things get added. Userland goes far beyond creating a 
desktop interface for their blogging system though. They've fully 
documented all the XML, XML-RPC, and SOAP tie-ins used to connect to 
their network, which could easily be adapted to other content 
management applications with some XML knowhow. Backend is the place to 
look ""under the hood"" at Userland's XML inner workings, including 
detailed documentation on making everything work. If you've got 
modifications or improvements to the system, they have an open 
discussion forum for trading ideas.

BELOW WHOLESALENEW, AND IN QUANTITIES YOU NEED
A SINGLE UNIT, A PALLET,
  OR A TRUCKLOAD1. Do you consider yourself ""FINANCIALLY SECURE""?
2. Are you still looking for a very Real Business that can provide you and
  your family with the lifestyle you desire and deserve? Or,just a second
  income in your spare time?3. Would you invest $66.50 (A 25% discount off of our regular price of
  $99.95 during this limited time promotion. ) in a business that could make you
  ""FINANCIALLY SECURE""?
If so, read on:
This is not a get rich quick scheme, but, it is a way for you to get into
  a business with a minimal investment and, may be your first step towards a
  rewarding first, or second income. For the longest time, only those, who were
  able to make large investments were able to take advantage of this type of a
  business. We have made it possible for everyone to do it, and at a price
  everyone can afford.Â Corporate America has conditioned us to believe that security comes from
  employment. Yet layoffs are hitting an all time high, major corporations are
  failing and we hope to never become the victims of this downsizing, career
  burn out, illness or injury.
There was a time, when finding another job was not a problem, but today,
  the frightening reality for a lot of people is that ""the
  plastic in their wallets determines the quality of their lives.""
The hard facts show that our economy has moved from the industrial age
  into the INFORMATION, SERVICE AND RETAIL AGE. No longer can you depend on the
  corporation to provide your family with the security you seek.
If you are TIRED OF LIVING FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK, and are willing to
  work a few hours per week, than this may be for you.
Please read further:
We will show you how you can buy, new, not out of date, products for PENNIES

  addresses, phone and fax numbers, and their current HOT
  listings. Unlike othersÃ¿FFFF92 distribution businesses where you are provided with
  WHOLESALE CATALOGS, out of date CD's, or lists of Government Auctions that
  sell Jeeps for $10, (which are a myth), we provide an unlimited virtual
  database of items at up to 95% below wholesale from liquidators, not
  wholesalers, that is up-dated on a weekly/daily basis by the suppliers. And
  the products are available for immediate purchase and shipping to you.
This database is designed for the individual or a small business. Although
  there are suppliers in this database selling in large quantities, most are
  selected for their flexability in being willing sell in small quantities at
  great savings (80 to 95% Below Wholesale)
You will be able to buy such items as RCA Stereos that retail for $250.00+
  for $20.00, New Boom Boxes for $12.50 each, Palm Pilots for $39.00, Cell Phone
  Antenna Boosters that sell on TV for $19.95- - for .16 cents, Perfect Pancake
  makers as seen on TV for $19.95, for$6.50, Disney Kids' clothes at $1.85/unit,

What do you get for your $66.50 investment:
A, fully executable, database of 100Ã¿FFFF92s of suppliers with hyperlinks to
  their websites, fax and phone numbers and a description of what type of
  product they handle and current product specials.And, ""On-going telephone support during normal business hours.""Â Since this is such a fast changing business, with new products being added
  and deleted on a weekly or even a daily basis, all data will be provided
  within 24 hours of receipt of payment via email file transfer. ( no waiting or
  shipping and handling costs) The $66.50 is your total
  one time cost.
This DATABASE is for individuals who recognize an opportunity to make a
  substantial income. Keep in mind, everyone likes a bargain, and even more so
  when the economy is down. So, even if you just want to buy for your own use, a
  single purchase could repay your initial investment. And, remember we provide
  a 30day, full refund satisfaction guarantee.
We know that this has been a brief description, and you may want
  additional information. You may email us at adddata7080@excite.com
  for additional information and a sample of listings currently being offered by
  various suppliers. (If you give us some idea of what
  types of products interest you, we will try to include some sample listings of

I don't think you should worry too much about someone travelling out of 
the hive, but again, I'm curious as to how the driver actually modifies 
the keys on the server.> (2) The risks of a compromise to the client (far more likely).  This

open for something nasty here.
Two other things spring to mind; 
1) If anyone can modify the key, how do you make sure that two users are 
not overwriting the same key, thereby causing undesirable effects.
2) If anyone have permissions to write to the key (and below), anyone can 
create thousands of extra keys under this key, thereby filling up the 
registry. The result of such a thing is obvious.If I got this all wrong, I'd be happy that you clarify a bit more and tell 
me where I might have misunderstood.

* Judge Grants Consumer Voice in ReplayTV Lawsuit  Hollywood Tries to Skip Over Consumers' ConcernsLos Angeles - Judge Florence Cooper today granted five ReplayTV owners
a voice in the court debate over their rights to record television
programs and to skip commercials using digital video recorders (DVRs).
The federal court denied the entertainment industry motion to dismiss
the ReplayTV owners' lawsuit and agreed to combine the consumer
lawsuit with an entertainment industry lawsuit filed last fall to ban
ReplayTV DVRs.""We're pleased the court has recognized that the debate about digital
video recorders must include the customers who purchase and use the
devices,"" said Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Intellectual
Property Attorney Robin Gross.""[T]he issue of whether the Newmark Plaintiffs' use of the ReplayTV
DVRs' send-show and commercial-skipping features constitutes fair use
will most likely figure prominently in both the ReplayTV action and
the Newmark action,"" wrote Judge Cooper in her opinion.Responding to the entertainment industry's lawsuit against DVR
manufacturers, EFF petitioned the court on behalf of the five ReplayTV
owners to declare legal their use of the digital devices also known as
personal video recorders (PVRs). EFF seeks to ensure that the legal
debate over DVRs will include consumers' concerns along with those of
the entertainment and consumer electronics industries.The entertainment industry claims that commercial skipping infringes
copyright and digital recording aids piracy.""I'm not a crook if I skip commercials or share a news interview of
myself with my mom using the SendShow feature rather than sending her
a videotape,"" said Craig Newmark, founder of craigslist.org and a
ReplayTV owner. ""I shouldn't have to worry about getting prosecuted,
but the Turner Broadcasting CEO tells us that taking a bathroom break
is criminal. We even have Senators urging Attorney General Ashcroft to
prosecute people who share files.""Along with Newmark, ReplayTV customers filing the lawsuit with legal
representation by the EFF are: Keith Ogden, owner of a financial
broker firm in San Francisco; Shawn Hughes, a small business owner in
Georgia; Seattle journalist Glenn Fleishman; and southern Californian
video engineer Phil Wright.Links:For this release:

* Musician Disputes Industry's Stance on Music Sharing  Janis Ian Urges Artists Speak Out, Support Free DownloadsSan Francisco - Grammy-winning songwriter and recording artist Janis
Ian today challenged the music industry by celebrating peer-to-peer
(P2P) music sharing as a boon to musicians.Ian, who is in the San Francisco Bay Area as part of her current
concert tour, recently published ""The Internet Debacle,"" a pointed
critique of the music industry's disregard for musicians and consumers
who want to distribute and acquire music online. The Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF) applauds Ian's actions and hopes that others
will see the Internet as an aid, not a threat, to musicians.In the article, Ian assails the major record labels' argument that P2P
file-sharing is harming artists.""Free Internet downloads are good for the music industry and its
artists,"" explains Ian. ""Every act that can't get signed to a major,
for whatever reason, can reach literally millions of new listeners,
enticing them to buy the CD and come to the concerts.""She adds that during the heyday of Napster she saw a marked increase
in CD sales from her website. She attacks technological and political
measures meant to harm consumers by restricting their right to copy
and back up their legally purchased music.Ian will play on August 17 in San Rafael, CA.During her 17 album career, Ian has earned nine Grammy nominations and
three awards. Her best known songs include 1967's ""Society's Child""
and 1975's ""At Seventeen."" More recently, her 1993 album ""Breaking
Silence"" was nominated for a Grammy Award as Contemporary Folk Album
of the Year. Her songs have been recorded by artists ranging from
Bette Midler to Cher, from Glen Campbell to Vanilla Fudge, and from
Joan Baez to Etta James.

* Court Hearing Set in DeCSS Publication Jurisdiction CaseOn September 5, 2002, the California Supreme Court will hear oral
arguments about whether a California court has jurisdiction over
Matthew Pavlovich, an Indiana college student who is a resident of
Texas, for his hosting of an Internet mailing list. Pavlovich
maintained the mailing list for the LiVid programming group, which
provides a unified development and user resource center for video and
DVD-related work for the Linux operating system. One of the group's
projects was to create a DVD player for computer systems that run
Linux. As part of that effort, DeCSS, a program that decrypts the copy
protection on DVDs, was published on the group's mailing list. The
entertainment industry has sued Pavlovich in California court, and
last year a California appellate court ruled Pavlovich was within the
state court's jurisdiction since he published information that relates
to the entertainment industry, which is based in California.EFF and Pavlovich's legal team argue that Pavlovich is outside of
California's jurisdiction since he was a college student in Indiana
with no contacts to California when DeCSS was published on the LiVid
list. The hearing on September 5 will take place in San Francisco.

* There is no documentation on their website about how I can complain about
  this and have their customers financially penalized for sending me unsolicited

  Their contract is with their customers, not with us.This is a scam!  Don't trust them!------- You are receiving this mail because: -------

  |[ ... ]
  |  the issue here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archives always
  |  contain the data for each name of a hard link.  [ ... ] ARRGGGHHHH!!!!!
 profuse apologies, the wrong version of my reply was posted
 (blame it on being late for the pub).  ;-( the above is almost pure B*S* --- I got my `tar's and `cpio's
 confused.  what I said _is_ correct, but for cpio(1) archives;
 tar(1) archives do _not_ replicate the data for hard links. I spotted this confusion on my part before I posted my reply,
 and re-wrote it to be more correct, yet somehow the wrong
 version got sent anyways.  ARRGGGHHHH!!!!!  ;-(  ;-(  ;-( anyways, GNU `cpio -p' does not do spurious reads or writes.
 GNU `tar cf - ... | tar xf - ...' also does not, albeit each
 `tar' both reads and writes the data.  hence, there is twice
 (not thrice!) the I/O of `cpio -p', maybe an issue for c.60Gb. using strace(1), I've verified my claim GNU `cpio -p' does
 not do spurious reads or writes, i.e. it link(2)s.  but having
 just come back from the pub, perhaps this should also be taken
 with extra skepticism ......   ;-\ sorry.  cheers!

much less elsewhere.  Population estimates vary wildly and about all
your average skeptic can do is take geometric means to get ballpark
figures.  While Central America may have had 20 or 30 million, vast
areas of South America were uninhabited and other places very
sparsely e.g., the plains Indians in what is now the U.S. may have
been 2 million or so.There are those who claim that the Mexican population declined from
20 something million to circa 8 or 10 million in the 16th century,
certainly, in part due to infectious diseases new and old, and other
factors, and was probably in decline before contact.  Others claim it
declined from 80-ish million to 3 or 4 million and somehow deduce 95%
mortality from imported diseases, and have a pretty clear agenda which
makes me (for one) take their claims with a large grain of salt.About all that is certain is that anyone alive in 1500 was dead in 1600,
in the Americas or elsewhere.R

However, if the query string containsvarname[]=FIRST&varname[]=SECONDthen PHP will create an array with varname[1]==FIRST and varname[2]==SECONDThere are other ways to get the data from the HTTP request, and I guess 
I'll do that if it turns out to simplify the script that creates the 
form; but as i understand it that's the ""official"" way to get data from 
a SELECT MULTIPLE using PHP.Dave

>Considering 90% of the fake job posting I see are for embedded systems or

static object allocation and a few other programming
techniques, performance differences disappear, but
C++ gives a boost in development and maintainability.
The real issue is compiler availability. Almost every
embedded platform has C cross-compilers. Many have
C++ compilers. But there is still a range of
platforms that have the first but not the second. Or
at least, that was the story a few years ago._________________________________________________________________

Date: Not suppliedThis is the headline of the month, possibly the year: ""Doctors Grow Pig Teeth 
in Rat Intestines."" Do we even need to read the story to understand it? It's 
like a freaking _haiku_ of near-singularity, future-shocky wonderment!     U.S. doctors said on Thursday they have managed to grow living pig teeth in 
    rats, a feat of biotechnology that experts said could spark a dental 
    revolution.     Researchers at Boston's Forsyth Institute said their successful experiment 
    suggests the existence of dental stem cells, which could one day allow a 
    person to replace a lost tooth with an identical one grown from his or her 
    own cells.     ""The ability to identify, isolate and propagate dental stem cells to use in 
    biological replacement tooth therapy has the potential to revolutionize 
    dentistry,"" said Dominick DePaola, president and CEO of the institute that 
    focuses on oral and facial science.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Dave[3]!_)[1] http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&ncid=585&e=1&cid=585&u=/nm/20020926/sc_nm/health_teeth_dc

No, that would be rather silly. There are conflicting reports on whether
Zambia is prepared to accept milled GM grain or not - and, from reports from
various sources, considerable debate within that country. There's complex
issues, not all of which can be dismissed by blaming those nasty
environmentalists, which was my original point.TimC------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

I'm not sure they are doing strictly help-desk stuff.
But the whole 'who in their right mind would use that? it doesn't have all
these cool features!' isn't always a guarantee of failure - maybe there is a
strength in this approach (agents and/or IM as ui) than can find a nich
application space.>

Kind of like a web query - and with google, someone else can turn them into

What about a situation where you don't directly ask/talk to the bot, but
they listen in and advise/correct/interject/etc?
example: two people discussing trips, etc. may trigger a weather bot to
mention what the forecast says - without directly being asked.

is that they were going on phenotypes,
and didn't engineer the genetics.  That
example makes a good case for natural
selection, but not for artificial.(do ""married people live longer"" because
of the benefits of matrimony, or because
acceptable health is one of the qualities
selected for in spouses?)Of course, if there are FoRKs with six
or fewer biological great grandparents
(or who are offspring of Wilt) I should
eat my words; otherwise, the micro/macro
distinction seems much more relevant.-Dave> I guess that the reason that I disagree is that some groups arguing

for checks: livestock owners have, over a
period of millenia, altered the genetics
of their herds to be dumber, meatier, and
more tolerant of industrial living, so if
caution is in order, they are some of the
least likely people to volunteer it.

Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today
By Michael E. AngierThis is my list. They're the ones I've selected for my life at
present. Consider them suggestions for yourself--ideas to 
help you generate your own top ten list. By getting clear 
on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be 
moving toward and experiencing your highest and best.
1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for
which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will
have even more to appreciate.2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize 
how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. 
EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly 
imagine.3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and 
drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more 
calories. Eat only small amounts at one time.5. Read something educational, inspirational or
entertaining--preferably all three.6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the
Super-conscious.7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy.8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of 
my book, then write in my journal.9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful, 
magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.Bonus Step: Make something work better -- 
Practice ADS: Automate, Delegate and Systemize.

~~~~~~~~~No. This is a funny thing to me.  I hear about so many 
people being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, 
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address 
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.  We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and 
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do 
who knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person 
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy 
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that 
person (me) would have her account info and could write 
a check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send 
it to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her 
to tell me what the difference was between the original check 
and a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never 
heard back from her.  The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is 
available in many places.  Have a good day.
--  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html
~~~~~~~~~Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, 
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most 
importantly, never give any personal information at a site 
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar 
or a Veri secure sign or others. Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put 
in my credit information in each time instead of having 
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks 
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet 
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is 
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web 
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!

~~~~~~~~~Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that 
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner 
was in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address 
went unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; 
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com 
address to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building 
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place 
on 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I 
lost a minimum of $50,000.  
 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first 
time I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often 
enough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet 
theft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals 
and should spend years behind bars.
 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft; 
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by 
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

 Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Todayï¿½ï¿½This is my list. They're the ones I've selected for my life at
present. Consider them suggestions for yourself--ideas to
help you generate your own top ten list. By getting clear
on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be
moving toward and experiencing your highest and best.
Â 
1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for
which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will
have even more to appreciate.
2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize
how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it.
EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly
imagine.
3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.
4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and
drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more
calories. Eat only small amounts at one time.
5. Read something educational, inspirational or
entertaining--preferably all three.
6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the
Super-conscious.
7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy.
8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of
my book, then write in my journal.
9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful,
magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.
10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.
Bonus Step: Make something work better --
Practice ADS: Automate, Delegate and Systemize.

No. This is a funny thing to me.Â  I hear about so many
people being super scared to give out their SS#.Â  Well folks,
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.Â  Give me a name and address
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.
We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.Â  They could do
who knows what with the CC number.Â  I once had a person
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that
person (me) would have her account info and could write
a check out for thousands of dollars.Â  I told her to just send
it to me then and she said that was OK.Â  Then I asked her
to tell me what the difference was between the original check
and a fax copy.Â  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.Â 
Never
heard back from her.
The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is
available in many places.Â  Have a good day.
--Â  TerryÂ Â Â

Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However,
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most
importantly, never give any personal information at a site
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar
or a Veri secure sign or others.
Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put
in my credit information in each time instead of having
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!

From: Bert01. I was so poor growing up...  if I wasn't a boy...  I'd have had
    nothing to play with.02. A girl phoned me the other day and said, ""Come on over; nobody's
    home.""  I went over. Nobody was home.03. During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me.  Just the
    other night she called me from a hotel04. One day I came home early from work...  I saw a guy jogging
    naked. I said to the guy, ""Hey buddy, why are you doing that?""  He
    said ""Because you came home early.""05. It's been a rough day. I got up this morning...  put a shirt on
    and button fell off.  I picked up my briefcase, and the handle
    came off.  I'm afraid to go to the bathroom.06. I was such an ugly kid...  When I played in the sandbox, the cat
    kept covering me up.07. I could tell my parents hated me.  My bath toys were a toaster and
    radio.08. I was such an ugly baby...  My mother never breast fed me. She
    told me that she only liked me as a friend.09. I'm so ugly...  My father carries around a picture of the kid who
    came with his wallet.10. When I was born, the doctor came into the waiting room and said to
    my father, ""I'm sorry. We did everything we could, but he pulled
    through.""11. I'm so ugly...  My mother had morning sickness...  AFTER I was
    born.12. I remember the time that I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of
    my finger to my father.  He said he wanted more proof.13. Once when I was lost, I saw a policeman, and asked him to help me
    find my parents. I said to him, ""Do you think we'll ever find
    them?"" He said,""I don't know kid. There's so many places they can
    hide.""14. My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.15. I'm so ugly...  I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how
    big I'd get.16. I went to see my doctor. ""Doctor, every morning when I get up and
    I look in the mirror...  I feel like throwing up; What's wrong
    with me?"" He said...  ""I don't know but your eyesight is perfect.""17. I went to the doctor because I'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping
    pills. My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.18. With my old man I got no respect. I asked him, ""How can I get my
    kite in the air?"" He told me to run off a cliff.19. Some dog I got. We call him Egypt because in every room he leaves
    a pyramid. His favorite bone is in my arm.  Last night he went on
    the paper four times - three of those times I was reading it.20. One year they wanted to make me poster boy - for birth control.21. My uncle's dying wish was to have me sitting in his lap; he was in
    the electric chair.

1610,"Dear Sir,My name is Mr. Obi W, the manager, credit and foreign bills of Eco
Bank Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank
with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash
[Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6,
1997.Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched
with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive
as no one has come to claim his funds of usd.20.5 m, [twenty million
five hundred thousand united states dollars] which has been with my
branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for whom
his name shall be used as the
next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the
banking ethics here does not
allow such money to stay more than five years, because money will be
recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view
of this I got your contact through a trade journal after realizing
that your name and country is similar to the deceased. I will give
you 25% of the total.Upon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail
the application, bank's fax number and the next step to take. I will
not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and
that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund
transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply
to the bank as a relation to the deceased.When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying
Your decision including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick
communication.Respectfully submitted,Obi   W.

I occasionally buy X-10 stuff.  I've learned from past experiences to 
create a quick mail alias to get order confs and what not.  Then can 
it once the order is complete because those spamming SOBs will not 
stop filling my inbox with 3-6 ads per day.  I've LARTed them and 
their upstream numerous times asking to be list washed.  I don't even 
get an auto-ack.  I started a procmail recipe to reject mail to them 
and include a form letter (I was planning on later appending every 
piece of x-10 spam I've archived to the form letter for their reading 
pleasure...) but I haven't gotten it to work.  Bottom line, if I gave 
them permission to mail me (explicitly or via privacy policy), it's 
not spam but once I told them to stop mailing me then it's spam.My $.02

Dear Friend,This last summer, our family had a big reunion at a fabulous resort in 
Minnesota. Â The water was sapphire blue and the evergreens sang as the 
breeze rustled their limbs. Â We had such a great time renewing old 
friendships, seeing how everyone's children had grown, and catching up on 
everyone's lives. Â The last day we had a family picture taken, thinking 
that we'd all send them out as our Christmas cards.In October we got the proofs back so that we could pick our favorite picture. 
Everybody looked wonderful and the background was spectacular but I could not 
find myself in the picture. Â I looked and looked and finally got out a 
magnifying glass. Â To my horror, I found this dark curly headed woman 
with a face that looked like a stretched moon!!! Â Dear God it was me!!! 
Â My body resembled an inflated hot air balloon that would take off should 
a heavy wind arise... it was HIDEOUS! Â I had mirrors in my house but most of them were 
designed to only reflect Â from the waist up and I honestly hadn't noticed 
that my cheekbones had totally disappeared and that my face looked like a 
shapeless clump of flesh. Â I was always so happy that I didn't have a lot 
of wrinkles, Â but I didn't realize that I wasn't wrinkled because my skin 
was as stretched as tight as a bongo drum.Well, this situation was NOT  acceptable. Â But I was at a loss as to what to do. 
Â My willpower, well, basically sucks and I had so-o-o much weight to lose 
that I wasn't sure I'd live long enough to get it all off. Â Plus, I hate 
diets and can only stick to them for a very short period of time before I fall 
off the food wagon. Â My goal to slim down seemed totally hopeless.AND THEN 
IT HAPPENED. Â I received a brochure about a product called 
BERRY TRIM 
PLUS. Â It seemed to contain everything I needed. Â 
It curbs your appetite, increases energy, burns fat at the fastest rate 
possible, no special diets are required, you don't have to exercise like a 
lunatic, it doesn't make you feel speeded, Â AND IT 'S ALL NATURAL WITH NO 
ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS. Â It also was priced well below other products so 
I figured that if it didn't work I wouldn't be out much money. Â It is 
guaranteed, but I'm always too lazy to bother to send back the empty bottles 
so this diet supplement seemed perfect for me.It's been about 6 weeks now but I swear I'm beginning to look like that 
famous Cindy person that models. Â My cheekbones are absolutely glorious.. 
I swear I look like a new person and a good one at that. Â BERRY TRIM 
PLUS  also keeps your skin tight so you don't look like a 
Shar Pei with nasty folds of skin hanging all around after you lose the weight.
I promise you that this product works. Â It does everything it promises 
and then some. Â Just losing the weight alone, makes you feel so much 
better and younger. Â It puts zest back into your life and assures you 
that you'll achieve your weight loss goals. Â In another few weeks I will 
reach my goal...something I had given up on. Â Also, HLNA  offers an affiliate 
program so you might as well make a few bucks while losing those pounds.
Please keep the faith and order this product NOW  by clicking below.CLICK

Oh.  OK.
 
These results don't help break EC crypto at all.
 
With RSA, you pick a number with secret factors and to break the
cryptosystem, you can factor the number.  Due to fast sub-exponential
algorithms for factoring, the number had better be 1024 bits at the
very least (record = 524 bits).
 
With EC, you pick a curve and pick points on the curve with secret
discrete logarithm.  To break the cryptosystem you can compute a
discrete log but the best algorithms for random curves are exponential
(record = 109 bits, for a slightly special curve).
 
Up until now, people pick curves chosen from a small fixed set.  One
choice is a few curves with special properties that originally were
chosen to make point-counting easier, and can also speed up the crypto
operations, but in some cases they can also speed up attacks, not on
curves deployed at the moment but the danger exists.  The other
choice is to precompute a handful of random curves.  The NSA did this
a few years ago when it took hours on a fast machine and NIST
standardized those curves.
 
What changes is that it is now possible is to generate your own curves
on an ordinary PC.  This has been getting easier and easier, with
small curves taking seconds on a fast machine since a year or two.
Now even reasonably big curves take seconds on a typical PC.
 
This means that you don't have to rely on standard curves but can
distribute risk over many curves in case some get broken at some
stage.  In certain circumstances you can even keep the curve itself
secret so an attacker doesn't know which discrete log to try to
compute!  There isn't really a good analogy with RSA, but imagine
wanting to factor a number and you don't even know what it is...
 
So basically recent progress has made new things feasible and this
makes them even more so.  The underlying primitives for signing,
encoding and so on are not affected, but the security vibes get better.

END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these
Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be
ordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and
you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and
address of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that
slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's
slot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.
Check the address again.Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and
replace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and
replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This
step is how your own name and address is entered into the
list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,
your own name will go down the list of names until you have
reached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The
key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from
you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out
this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to
as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000
emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings
you make, potentially the greater the number of people who
will order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then
make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email
showing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of
this email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps
shown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as
many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help
those who purchase the Guides from you to send out
emails of their own.Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate
reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list
with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.
That might seem to you like a clever move because new
buyers will be sending their money to these people.  But
that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.
What will benefit you most is having people who will send
out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new
buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to
be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by
effectively closing down the program with your name on
top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There
wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver
will gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done
the work, and your name has worked its way to further
down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and
earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for
anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't
do it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to
the five people on the list that one of the people will just
take your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest
assured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have you
as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find
new buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to
cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  The people on the list
would rather have you working hard because your effort will
benefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send
you the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal
by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.
Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.
******END OF SUMMARY************************=======REST OF MESSAGE======================With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in
this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary
people who may not have done any internet marketing before.
And the earnings potential is staggering!READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a
RECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can
afford to buy that new car or home that you have been
looking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never
responded to one of these before either. One day though,
something made me feel: ""You use $50 going to a movie
for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple
meat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?""  No matter where
you believe those ""feelings"" came from, I thank every day
that feeling came over me.I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing
had I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,
YouÂ’ll learn how to become a more effective communicator.
What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and
confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover
your investment and make some good money: making over
half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.
If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct
marketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing
via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done
in the future, then the experience you will gain here could
be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing
a new career for you.= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =If you want to make serious money, read this message until
you understand it completely and feel confident to follow
through on what it advises.FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,
it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You
are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such
and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period
of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and
the others on the list of five.===========================================
*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER
CHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY
===========================================Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that
you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.
Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%
(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better
but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will
send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only
5,000 each.Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only
5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also
send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of
those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.
That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders
for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each
for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response
is 625 orders for Guide # 4.Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total
of 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125
orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This
may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a
very low response rate with a small number of emails being
sent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate
up just slightly.If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone
or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
emails each or more?  From the example above, you can see
the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the
amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide
and counting, with thousands more coming online every day.METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
===========================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are
Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on
the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start
with  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.
For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the
Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise
you how to get the large number of email addresses that
you need to send the new email containing your name and
address.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,
you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to
their email addresses.  This will benefit you because your
name would be further down the list, and their new buyers
will buy from you.  This is no different than ""customer
service"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or
somehow  ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks
or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it
is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope
and steal it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each
Guide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden
by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of
those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME
of the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS
and your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the
envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to
mail the envelope.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW
FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL
________________________________________________
YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1
within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,
you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If
not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,
YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and
cash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT
TO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice
and instruction on how to send out more emails. You can
KEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people
are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.
There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!

Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after
losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. 
Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000
more machines for the Japanese market. They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998.  
VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s
 
Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better
quality than its VHS rival. Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,
1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the
film rental industry and in homes. Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. ""With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the
market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to
secure parts,"" Sony said in a statement. Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the
format. The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the
television and film industries and will be unaffected. But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin
for Betamax home players. In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of
competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,
although VHS tapes had a longer duration. A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no
new ones will be made after the end of 2002. Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

Lennon killer seeks parole againThe man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for
early release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon's
62nd birthday.
Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the
superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980.
It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from
Attica state prison.
At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and
had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the
ex-Beatle.
Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star.
Shot dead
Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New
York City apartment on 8 December 1980.
He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session
during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice.
Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from
Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as
Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him.
The killer said Lennon had been just ""a picture on an album cover"" to him
before the shooting.
'Deserved death'
Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his
crime.
Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if
Chapman were released.
Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the
Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled
commercial success.
The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would
have been 62 on Wednesday.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

Tech shores up Homeland DefenseComputer security is becoming an increasingly critical part of President Bush's 
proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally proposed the department 
last month, he never mentioned the Internet or cybersecurity. But as Capitol Hill

Date: Not suppliedDan Gillmor interviewed Jack Valenti[1] last week in his column and did the 
impartial thing, representing Valenti's beliefs as fairly as possible. This 
week, Dan takes Valenti's arguments apart, looking at what Hollywood's agenda 
really entails:     So the movie and music companies are going back to Congress for another 
    helping. They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to 
    restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that 
    communicate so they can't make copies the copyright holders don't 
    explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants 
    permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used 
    to violate copyrights.     Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the 
    possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask 
    permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep 
    information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it's nothing 
    but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a 
    certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after 
    the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some 
    things that aren't infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing. 
    Saying it doesn't make it so.  Link[2] Discuss[3][1] http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/4132447.htm

4. WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NET
5. SITE STATISTICS
0. INTROHello SourceForge.net Users,This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any
large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to
the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.
These databases manage everything from user authentication, session
management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database-
dependent website.Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,
a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because
the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and
70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this
growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us
the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the
press release here:http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.htmlHow will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much
difference other then the site will continue to grow and the
SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later
phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of
the databases advanced capabilities.Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the
site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months.If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,
please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always
appreciate the feedback.Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the
Open Source Community.Pat-Patrick McGovern
Director, SourceForge.net1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITYSourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth
is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to
ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source
community can always obtain the software released by hosted
projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity
download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world,
as to provide better download times regardless of which network
provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location.Three new download servers have recently been added to our network,
further strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest
additions include servers hosted by:Time Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA);

http://www.umn.edu/CESNET (Czech Republic)
http://www.cesnet.cz/We thank these sponsors for their commitment to SourceForge.net and
the needs of the Open Source community.On a related note, we are looking for a mirror in Japan.  If you are
an ISP or University in Japan and are willing to spare 20Mbps for a
SourceForge.net mirror (we'll supply the hardware), please let us
know at bandwidth@sourceforge.net2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLESourceForge.net now has the audio from the entire 2002 OSDN/USENIX
Kernel Summit, held in June.  Listen to the Linux kernel master

replies that look like this:  ""Hey!! I didn't subscribe to this list!!!
You spammer. I hate you!  I hate your dog!  (insert other colorful
phrases here)"".  The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net
there was a check box that said ""Receive Site-wide updates, low
volume"".  You left it checked when you submitted the registration form,
hence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6
weeks, so it truly is low volume.  However if you want off, this is not
a problem.  Simply click on the link below.

this continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Even
for descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendents
of slaves, who were brought here by force.More stuff, cheaper. That's progress.Poverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity in
wealth has nothing to do with it.It's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, only
individuals do. Like group rights, ""disparity"" in wealth is
statistical sophistry.
Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealth
is almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when
there are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes
400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there
since 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on
wealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point,
they're nowhere near the top.I'll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself,
in the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislated
monopoly, corporate welfare, ""non-profit"" neoaristocratic tax dodges,
and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, like
what happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970's USA.In fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most ""unfairly""
distributed, that you get the most improvement in the general --
economic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, more
people living longer.I'll take those odds as well. People take greater risks when the
returns are higher, improving the lot of us all as a result.Cheers,

http://www.phc.mpr.org/posthost/index.shtmlDear Garrison,There are at least six plans about what to do with
""Ground Zero"" in New York. I believe a suitable memorial
surrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,
children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such
as a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works
would be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.
What do you think should done with the space?Joe Adams
Hillsdale, New JerseyI dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan
that's designed by committee and that's gone through
public hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be cold
and ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more
public space that the public hates, of which there are
plenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city
and that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young
ambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the
towers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historic
events occurred in New York that in any other city would
be commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and
historical museums and in New York there's barely a
little plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation.
It's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for
their big chance, and compared to that spirit of
entrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a
statue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant's
Tomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President
Grant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomb
and think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all
the things that New York is about. If you want to find
Grant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New
York: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial
city. New York is for the young and lively.",0

1449,">>From the Desk of Mr. Kenneth Uba
 
Union Bank of Nigeria,
 
Lagos-Nigeria.
 
 
 
ATTN: THE PRESIDENT/C.E.O
 
STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 
 
 
Dear Sir,
 
I am Mr. Kenneth Uba, the manager bills and exchange
at the Foreign Remittance Department of the Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. 
 
I am writing this letter to ask for your support and
cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. 
 
We discovered an abandoned sum of $31,000,000.00 (Thirty One million United States Dollars only) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family of a wife and two children in November 1997 in a Plane crash.
  
Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as
the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative has ever appeared to claim the said fund. 
 
Upon this discovery, I and other officials in my department have agreed to make business with you and release the total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since no one came for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank, otherwise the fund will be returned to the bank's treasury as unclaimed fund.
 
We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus; 
20 % for you as foreign partner, 75 % for us the officials in my department and 5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign expenses incurred by us and you during the course of this business.
 Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one of my colleagues will come to your country and mind our share. It is from our 75 % we intend to import Agricultural machineries into my country as a way of recycling the fund.  To commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e-mail and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number full name and address and your designated
bank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer can be made.Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of its nature. 
 
I look forward to receiving your prompt response.
 
 
 
Mr. Kenneth Uba
 
Union Bank of Nigeria.

1646,"Dear friend,
May I briefly introduce myself to you. I am Hajia Maryam Abacha, the wife of late Nigerian Head of State, General Sanni Abacha, who died on the 8th of June 1998. ever since the death of my husband, my family has been facing a lot of problems mostly with the present civilian government. Consequently, my son - Mohammed Abacha has been under torture in detention for a sin he did not commit and made to make a lot of confessions as regards valuables and money, including that of my late husband entrusted in his hand for safe keeping. 
The latest is the confession of the US$700,000,000.00 (Seven Hundred Million United States Dollars) cash his late father gave him for safe keeping. Please check News watch Magazine of May 8th / 15th, 2000 issue on [Website:http://www.newswatchngr.com] to confirm the above story. Also the recent publication by this day Newspaper on Thursday March 1st Edition, which London Court clear ways for more recovery of Abacha's family looted money. Please confirm this issue on website; http://www.thisdayonline.com, click the Archieve/2001/March 2001/Thursday March 1st.
On this note, I deposited a total sum of US$40,300,000.00 (Forty Million, three hundred thousand United states Dollars) sometimes March last year with a security company abroad (name withheld for now). Normally, we (1 and Mohammed Abacha) usually do such transactions, by first sending the money out by cargo to security company outside Nigeria, as photographic materials.
And thereafter go to the security company for claims before transferring it to any bank of our choice. Presently, I cannot travel out of Nigeria, because, if you have gone through the above mentioned website address, you will see how my son's confessions had implicated my husband and in fact the whole of my family. This has actually caused the federal Government of Nigeria to confiscate our International passports, frozen every of my family member's bank accounts, both home and abroad, even our properties. 
My problem now is, I want someone that can assist me move the US$40,300,000.00 (Forty Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) out from the Security Company and move the money to your country.
I shall be ready to negotiate with you any percentage you might want from the sum. On your advice I shall be ready to invest my own share of the sum in your country. I assure you that there will be no problems at all in the course of moving out the money. Please kindly contact me on my e-mail:mrsabacha_11@mail.com or FAX 234-1-7590893, I shall so much appreciate your immediate response for full details of the business which shall be given to you by my second son Mallam Mustafa Abacha. You should note also that my son - Mallam Mustapha Abacha shall handle all cases as regards this business; as he is well abreast with this transaction for I do not have access to telephone lines now because they have been tossed by security agents and my movement is being monitored. I would like my son (Mallam Mustafa Abacha) to settle down  or be involved in a dating relationship with any lucky foreign lady at the successful completion of the transaction.
In acknowledgement of my proposal, I would want you to furnish me with your telephone number, fax number and address so as to enable my son whom will be dealing with you directly to easily have you communicate as to how you will receive this money on our behalf risk-free.
Thanking you in anticipation to your kind understanding and cooperation. I am looking forward for a healthy business relationship with you  and my entire household. Hoping to hear from you.Best regards,Hajia Maryam Abacha.Call me on My Telephone Number 234-80-33357110please for security reasons reply through to the fax number FAX 234-1-7590893 instead of the email as it is general to all the family member.",1

I apologize for not catching up to the current code in so long.Now that I have I'm trying to resolve ""breakage"" and differences.The unseen window seems to have been replaced with the sequences 
window.  While I appreciate the flexibility of the sequences 
window, the unseen window filled an important-to-me need:  It 
was tiny and could be set to show on all desktops of a virtual 
window manager without taking a lot of space.  Since my normal 
mode of operation involves two copies of exmh displaying on a 
1024x768 vnc session, screen space is at a premium.As things stand now, I have a sequences window that shows a lot
more information than I need to have handy and takes up a lot 
more room than I can ""spare"".I can see that I could like the new sequences window a lot for 
certain operations.  But I'd like a nice uncluttered, tiny 
window that _only_ shows me info on my unread mail.One possibility that occurs to me would be a button or mouse
click that ""shrinks"" the Sequences window to show only the
sequences in the ""always show"" list.  And of course a way to 
expand it back.--Hal

that ""most rich people are smart"" and that the latter is causal to 
the former.  By implication, then, you would say that ""most poor 
people are stupid"".  This is true, statistically, because most 
people are poor and most people are also stupid.  However there's 
nothing to indicate a causal link there.  So being smart isn't the 
only mechanical requirement to eternal wealth because, obviously, 
most of the members of this list would be rich.Being smart, for example, has made Stephen Hawking famous and 
respected, but he's not particularly rich.  Jennifer Lopez is by 
all accounts a complete moron.  In fact, spend a weekend in Beverly 
Hills and you will encounter vast numbers of people who are 
profoundly stupid driving Rolls Royces and shopping at PRADA.The working class IS the market and the working class IS where 
wealth is created.  The working class makes long-distance calls, 
buys food processors and computers and clothes, and attaches the 
value to goods which allows them to be commodified.  The working 
class saves money, buys Retirement Savings Plans, and invests in 
mutual funds which increases the flow of capital through the 
investment funnel.The economic system of the first world is designed to strike a 
delicate balance between incentivizing the ruling class to support 
wealth-expanding through technological innovation or the 
development of new markets.  At the 100,000 foot level, recessions 
and depressions are created when more wealth is sucked from the 
whirlpool than can be supported by the working class through 
investment and consumption.And the people draining the hot tub are the folks in the ruling 
class -- people like Ken Lay, Dick Cheney, Bernie Ebbers, et al -- 
and they simply got too greedy and caused a bubble in the 
hydraulics that increased the pressure for a time, but ultimately 
wasn't sustainable.And the money that was lost did not come from the ruling class.  It 
came from the RSP's and the Equity funds and the Investments of 
individual working class -- people who believed these reports and 
invested.  The wealth of the ruling class was largely pulled out by 
the time such investments were exposed to the workers.So, is the lower caste necessarily stupid for saving money or 
investing in retirement plans?  I don't think so.  Are they stupid 
for buying clothes and automobiles?  I don't think so.At the granular level, the notion that ""most rich people are rich 
because they're smart"" is so anecdotal and naive that it's not 
worth arguing about, so I won't.  Still, a compelling point worth 
some clarification.-Ian.http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

September 11, 2002 8:00 a.m.
The Wages of September 11
There is no going back.September 11 changed our world. Those who deny such a watershed event take a
superficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply
because the sun still rises and sets.This is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing
into the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans Â— all seen live in real
time by millions the world over Â— tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,
which, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers
dealt in icons Â— the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the
manifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and
centering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,
they got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing
has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.Islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally
repugnant Â— and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By
lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the
vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and
bombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only
ghoulish not fearsome.The more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found
them both vile and yet banal Â— and so is confident and eager to eradicate
them and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite
another to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily
dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good
theater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British
commandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and
an occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of
the attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,
but also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,
the plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist
paradise on earth.Foreign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with
Europe, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic
nomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters Â—
a paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold
War. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has
insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an
antidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power
is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often
dubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally
exposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the
moment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed
the problems inherent in ""the European way"" became all too apparent:
pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract
moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and
constant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire
while we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with
only a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more
sobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European
hobbits after September 11.America learned that ""moderate"" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile
Islamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti
means nothing special to an American Â— at least not proof of being any more
friendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.
Indeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of
their anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases Â— like NATO Â— belongs to a
pre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn
that broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is
just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles Â— and as likely to come
from friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan
offer more long-term hope than ""stable regimes"" like the Saudis; governments
that hate us have populations that like us Â— and vice versa; the Saudi royal
family, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which
has snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic
reformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic
governments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as
Arab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.The post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the
military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq ""chicken
hawks"" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings
hollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan's shrillness
against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery
ended than resonant of Patton's audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.
More Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those
soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30
years ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of
Vietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no
generation of Americans in the present military Â— other than a few thousand
brave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama Â— who have been in
sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American
soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security
is lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in
lower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the
Pentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.Real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than
rejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad
as our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at
home. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into
harm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect
thousands in high-rises.Politics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical
conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes
repellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe
to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose
belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were
so often at loggerheads with naÃ¯ve and idealist leftists.No longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet
Communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions
of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise
open economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,
even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in
the Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if
multiculturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western
construct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim
nonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not the
Left, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and
idealism Â— with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president
astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.All this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the
subsequent terrible year Â— and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we
will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.",0

How to Publish Your Windows XP FTP Server to the Internet
Several of you wrote in about last week's article on installing an FTP Server. You said ""that was great, but you only told half the story"". You wanted to know two more things:How to make the FTP Server available to Internet users
How to secure the FTP ServerThere are several ways to make an FTP server on the internal network available to users on the Internet. These methods are referred to as ""Server Publishing"". You can use a Windows XP computer running Internet Connection Services (ICS) to publish a server on your internal network.Let's take a look at a common scenario. You have a Windows XP computer connected to the Internet with an always-on cable or DSL connection. You have another computer on your private network also running Windows XP. You've installed the FTP Server on this internal network computer and put files into the FTP folder. Now you want Internet users to connect to the FTP Server through the ICS computer directly connected to the Internet.You can do this with the Windows XP ICS! Here's how:Go into the Network Connections window. You can get there from the Network applet in the Control Panel.
Right click the network interface directly connected to the Internet and click Properties.
Click on the Advanced tab in the connection's Properties dialog box. Put a checkmark in the Internet Connection Firewall checkbox. Always make sure the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled when you connect a computer directly to the Internet.
Click the Settings button, then click on the Services tab in the Advanced Settings dialog box.
Now click the Add button. This brings up the Service Settings dialog box. Type in My FTP Server in the Description of service text box. In the Name or IP address text box, type in the IP address of the computer on your private network that's running the FTP server. Since you're using ICS, it'll have an IP address like 192.168.0.x, where x is different for each machine on your network. You might want to manually assign the IP address the FTP Server already has, so that it doesn't change in the future. You can find out what IP address your FTP server is using by opening a command prompt at the FTP server and typing in the command ipconfig. That will give you the IP address the FTP Server is using. Back to the Service Settings dialog box, select the TCP option button. For the External Port and the Internet port, put in the port number you assigned to the FTP server on your internal network. Read this week's How To section to see how to change the listening port number. Clic!
k OK
Click OK, and then click OK one more time! You might need to disable and enable the adapter after making the change. You can do that by right clicking the always-on interface.The procedure is very similar for dial-up connections. However, there are problems with dial-up connections (and many always-on connections) because the IP address on the external interface of the ICS computer changes over time. Next week I'll share with you a cool way you can get around this problem by using something called a ""dynamic DNS service"". I've used one for years, and it works great. Make sure to tune in next week for the details.There you have it. Is server publishing in your future? Have any questions on the method I described above? If so, let me know! There are lots of ways you can publish services. Tell me how you do it, and tricks you've learned along the way. If you're having problems with server publishing, let me know about those too! I'll be sure to include what I learn from you in upcoming newsletters.Until next week,

Allow Dial-up Connections to Synchronize Time with Internet Time Servers
Do you use a dial-up connection but can't get your machine to synchronize its clock with an Internet time server when the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled? If so, here's a tip Richard Surry sent in on how to fix the problem:Open your Network Connections window from the start menu.
Right click on your modem (or other dial-up connection) and click Properties.
Click on the Advanced tab. You already have a checkmark in the box that enables the ICF. Click on the Settings button.
Click on the Services tab, then click on the Add button in the Services tab.
That should open the Service Settings dialog box. In the Description box, put in Internet Time Service. For the Name or IP address of the computer hosting this service on your network, type in 127.0.0.1. Select the TCP  protocol option button. For both the external and internal port numbers, type 123.
If you're online, disconnect and reconnect. Now synchronize the time by double click on the clock in the system tray and going to the Internet Time tab.This is an interesting tip, and it represents an even more interesting problem. For you network geeks out there, I'll ask you this question: Why should we allow unsolicited inbound connections for the Internet Time Service? The ICF should not block responses to solicited outbound connections, so why should we have to enable reverse NAT to make this work?
Â Â Â HOW TO'S: ALL THE NEW XP FEATURES
Â 
How to Secure an FTP Server on Windows XP Professional
Last week we went over how to install the Windows XP FTP Server. It will work fine after going through the steps outlined last week, but several of you asked for more information on how to secure the FTP Server because you wanted to connect it to the Internet. It's a very good idea to understand how FTP security works before putting the server on the Internet. Here are some suggestions:Open the Internet Information Services console from the Administrative Tools menu. In the left pane of the console, expand your server name and then expand the FTP Sites node.
Right click on the Default FTP Site and click the Properties command.
Click on the FTP Site tab. Notice that the default TCP Port is set to 21. This is the well-known port for FTP. You can increase security a bit by changing this port to another value that's in the 1026-65534 range. This secures it from poorly motivated click-kiddies and also allows you to get around your ISP blocking incoming connections to TCP port 21. Friends who connect to your FTP server will need to change the port number on their FTP client software as well.
The Windows XP FTP server has a hard coded limit of 10 simultaneous connections. You might want to change this to a lower number to reduce the chance of a LAN party on the external interface of the FTP server.
Put a checkmark in the Enable Logging checkbox. Click the Properties button to the right of the log format drop-down list box. Click the Daily option button on the General Properties tab. On the Extended Properties tab, select all of the Extended Properties. Click OK.
Click on the Security Accounts tab. Place a checkmark in the Allow only anonymous connections checkbox. This prevents users from sending username and password credentials to the FTP server. You don't want users to send credentials because those credentials are sent in ""clear text"", which can be read by anyone who's listening on the wire.
Click the Messages tab. Enter a Welcome message, an Exit message, and a message users will see if there are no available connections.
Click on the Home Directory tab. Make sure there is a checkmark in the Read and Log Visits checkboxes. REMOVE the checkmark in the Write checkbox. Note the location in the Local Path text box. Navigate to that path in the Windows Explorer.
Right click on the FTPROOT folder and click Properties.
Click on the Security tab. Make sure that SYSTEM has Full Control. Assign the IUSR_ account READ access only. Remove all other permissions for the IUSR account. Make sure you give Adminstrators Full Control tool. This allows you, the administrator on the FTP Server computer, to add, remove and change files in the FTPROOT folder.Stop and restart the FTP Server. Now your FTP server is secure and Internet bad guys won't be able to use it to distribute porno and bootlegged software.

Cumulative Patch for Windows Media Player
I think it was a couple months ago when I wrote about some serious problems with the Windows Media Player (WMP). At that time you could download a ""cumulative"" patch that would update the Media Player with the latest security fixes. Well, it's time to download another ""cumulative"" patch! A couple other problems were found in WMP that could cause some problems. To read more about the problem head on over to:
http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709SE-WMP_PatchYou'll also find the download locations for Windows Media Player versions 6.4, 7.1 and 8.0 (XP) on that page.
Cumulative Patches for Excel and Word for Windows
If you run Microsoft Word or Excel, versions 2000 or 2002 (XP), then you need to head on over to the Microsoft site to download some security fixes. These fixes handle security glitches that could get you in trouble if you don't take care of them! Head on over to Microsoft's site where you can find individual fixes for each program. You only need download the fix that applies to your computer:

Â Â Â UPGRADING & COMPATIBILITY ISSUES
Â 
A Computer May Hang During a Heavy Load with an Ericsson HIS Modem
If your computer has a Ericsson HIS modem, you might experience a dreaded blue screen and see the message IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL. The problem is that you're downloading too much and your poor modem can't keep up! Microsoft recognizes that this isn't a problem with the modem, but with the modem driver. To download a fix visit Microsoft's site. After getting the fix, you can download as much as you like without worrying about blue screens!
http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709UP-HIS_Modem
Knowledge Base Search Center - If it is Not Broke, Do Not Break it!
It wasn't so long ago when you could search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for articles that came up in the last 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days and 6 months. It was great! But Microsoft decided to ""fix"" the Knowledge Base search page, and now it really sucks! It's hard to find things that used to come up easily, the site is often down, and searching based on age of articles just doesn't work anymore.Try this: go to:
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?ln=EN-US&pr=kbinfo&
and on the left side of the page select Windows XP in the top drop down list box. Don't put anything in the For solutions containing...(optional) text box. Leave the Any of the words entered option selected in the Using drop down list box. For Maximum Age select 3 days. For Results Limit select 150 articles. Click Search Now. Whoa! Nothing. OK, it's reasonable to see no articles related to Windows XP in the last 3 days. Try again, this time using 7 days. Whaat? Still no articles. OK, it was a holiday week in the USA last week. Let's try 14 days. Nothing again! That seems sort of strange, doesn't it? Let's give it another try with 30 days. Still no articles! What's going on here? Keep trying for 6 months and one year. You still won't find anything. It's pretty sad, because this used to work.

A Description of the Repair Option on a Local Area Network or High-Speed Internet Connection
Here's the answer to a question I've had for a long time. What the heck does that ""Repair"" option for a network connection actually do? It's not in the help file, but it's on the Microsoft Web site. Here's what it does:Sends an ipconfig /renew
Flushes the ARP cache with a arp -d
Reloads the NetBIOS name cache with a nbtstat -R
Updates its WINS server with an nbtstat -RR
Clear out the DNS client cache with an ipconfig /flushdns
Reregisters the client with a DDNS server with a ipconfig /registerdnsCheck out the original article over at:

Keyboard and Mouse Do Not Work When You Start Windows
Have you been hit with this one? You're working in Windows XP and shut down for the day. The next morning you start up your Windows XP computer and the mouse pointer is stuck! The only way to get it going again is to restart the computer, and for some reason the pointer starts moving again. What's up with that? I still haven't figured that one out, but Microsoft has a KB article that claims it's from a corrupt registry. I doubt that's the case in my situation because the problem is intermittent. But if you find that your mouse is always stuck, you might want to check out:

>1. Which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters.
>
A)  Which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its past? 
 Certainly not Christianity, Islam, etc.
B) ""How it is currently being expressed"" amounts to a tacit 
acknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and 
people's self-limiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive 
expression.  This leads to the point that religion and less 
sophisticated societies are a dangerous mix.  It also tends to invoke 
the image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of 
society.
C) Many splinter Christianity religions have 'clean hands' but they also 
aren't 'found in the wild'.(By ""primitive expression"", I don't mean to slight any society, but that 
there is some chronic evidence of irrational mob actions and uncivilized 
behavior (killing infants, women to break religious blue laws, etc.). 
 The US has only really been mostly free of ""primitive expression"" for 
40-50 years, although large categories, including serious religious 
conflict, were settled quite a while ago.)D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently more or 
less concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated 
by splitting society too much along religious lines.  One Post article 
pointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical 
integration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools, 
government, political party, etc.  (Of course both cases have a heritage 
of British conquest, but who doesn't?)(I couldn't find the article I remember, but here are a couple of others:)
http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A33761-2001Jul8&notFound=true
http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A15956-2002Jul16&notFound=true'Northern Ireland is a British province of green valleys and 
cloud-covered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and 
religiously divided. About 54 percent of the population is Protestant, 
and most Protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part 
of Britain. The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican, or 
nationalist; they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south.
In 1968, Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the 
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign in the American South. But 
violence quickly broke out, with ancient religious animosities fueling 
the political argument. Armed paramilitary groups sprung up on both 
sides. Police records and historians agree that the most lethal group by 
far was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a goal of a united 
IrelandThe provincial police force estimates that about 3,600 people were 
killed during the 30-year conflict known, with characteristic Northern 
Ireland understatement, as ""The Troubles.""'>2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.
>
That's fine, as it would be an inappropriate concentration.  It would be 
difficult to address the issues raised here in a clean way.  I'd be 
happy with an acknowledgement that the connection is there.>3. US Leadership remains reflexively multi-cultural.
>
This is ok to a point, as long as it doesn't shy away from logical, 
objective analysis of when a society could be seriously improved in 
certain ways.>>We all have

Subject: [camram-spam] another framework hashcash related frameworkThere is a framework for using a hashcash like proof of work function
as a way to frustrate junk mailers in this paper:""Curbing Junk E-Mail via Secure Classification""by E. Gabber, M. Jakobsson, Y. Matias, A. Mayer Bellin FC98.Online copy here:http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/27735.html(Look in the view or download section at the top right, it's
availabile in at least .pdf and .ps formats).The framework they propose with proxies etc looks a lot like the
current camram architecture, with a proof of work to get on a white
list.  They use target revokable email addresses (basically identical
to the LWPA concept) to implement the white list.The resulting framework is essentially identical to what I proposed in
recent message with:Subject: target revokable email addresses, and postage-free tokensTheir idea of including the postage free-token in the email address,
mirrors what is done in LWPA and makes the system exhibit smoother
migration for non-users.  eg. you can use varied sender addresses and
it will still work, you can forward the email address to someone else
and it will still work etc.They have some software architecture diagrams and suggestions for
installing some of the proxies on a corporate gateway -- ""gatekeeper""
they call it.Adam---------------------------------------------------------------------

LAGOS - NIGERIA.
YOUR KIND ATTN.,RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this
mail, if the contents does not meet with your personal
and business ethics, I apologize in advance.I am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law), I
represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzoâ€™s estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief
security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the
person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the
advent of a new democratic
dispensation in the country under the leadership of
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under
severe persecution due to the sensitive position he
held in the last military regime, presently he is
under house arrest restricted only to the confines of
his village.The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a
business proposal that might be of interest to you. My
client has informed me of the existence of funds
deposited with a security company abroad. This fund
came about as part of security votes that were
allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure
as chief security adviser to the then president. What
happened was that he had part of the funds transferred
from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this
security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
security outfit of the
then president. But before the purchase could take
place the president died. My client has decided to
keep this for himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime. But due to his
incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the
change of possession to his benefit.I have been mandated by my client to source for a
foreign partner that can help him facilitate the
change of possession. The deposit certificate and the
code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in
my possession.The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand
United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.I remain most obliged.Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP).

Date: 2002-09-25T18:54:10-06:00One of the weirdest things I heard when listening to the Cato Institute debate 
was an economist claim ""a tenet of my profession is that people won't pay for 
something they can get for free."" Someone objected, using the analogy of 
bottled water. There's a far better example: The New York Times.  Incredibly, this institution puts out pages and pages of high-quality 
professional content each week and then distributes them by means of men in 
trucks across the country overnight where they sit, waiting to be sold to 
people. Meanwhile, the exact same content is available _for free_ using an 
insidious peer-to-peer downloading system called ""the Web"" by typing in the 
keyword ""www.nytimes.com"". Those people at the New York Times must not 
understand the Internet or something! More examples: the thriving shareware market, the Baen Free Library, Janis Ian 
and others. Other times, people claim that no one will create if they can't get paid. I'd 
like to introduce you to free software and just about every weblog on the

Eliminator's all natural ingredients help you
sleep!Â Â Â Â Â Â  1r
Is snoring
keeping you up all night? No
more sleepless nights with
Snore Eliminator!!
Let your family sleep again by using the Snore Eliminator!
Do you know someone with a snoring problem? Snore Eliminator will help them
and they will love you for it.
Improve your sexual performance by reducing snoring and thus increasing
oxygen to your body!!People who snore have a higher risk of developing heart attacks, high blood
pressure, or strokes!! Snoring
also causes sleep disturbances that lead to increased anxiety,
hyperirritability, and decreased memory!
Individuals who snore have a 90% chance of daytime fatigue. Nine out of every
ten victims are male!How the Snore Eliminator will help you!What Causes Snoring?Over-relaxed throat and tongue muscles due to poor throat muscle
Excessive fat on the throat
Accumulation of secretion in the back of the throat and
Throat swelling from allergies and food
Heavy snoring is often associated with apnea, or the stopping
of breathing, during sleep. As
an individuals sleeps his or her sleeping pattern is disrupted and fragmented
due to snoring, thus they are never well rested. This can be a very hazardous
problem if someone is not getting proper REM sleep. Snoring is the audible
symptom of a blocked airway during sleep.The noise is caused by a vibration in the soft palate as the lungs pull hard
to take in a weakened current of incoming air. This blockage may result
from any number of circumstances, and these offer clues to get rid of the
problem.
Snoring is also more than likely to occur among people who sleep on their
backs; the tongue falls back toward the throat and partly closes the airway.The hidden dangers of snoring?
Snoring could increase the chances of a heart attack if not treated
Hypertension and increased anxiety are associated with snoring
Snoring causes sleep apnea a serious treatable medical conditionSnoring decreases sexual performance
by half, due to lack of oxygen
to the brain which decreases sexual responsiveness.
Most people who snore have a shortage
of oxygen for a
significant portion of that person's life. In recent studies, daytime fatigue
and cardiovascular disorder are related to snoring. In a few cases, heavy
snoring is a sign of potentially life -threatening problem. Sleep apnea in which
breathing stops for a second or even minutes at a time and finally resumes with
snorting and tossing around. This pattern may be repeated hundreds of times all
night long. The result is chronic oxygen shortage, which leads to abnormal heart
rhythms, high blood pressure, and heart strain.How the Snore Eliminator works!Snore Eliminator offers a unique break through with its all natural
enzymes which metabolize the
secretions, allowing the body to absorb them into the back of the throat. The
herbs reduce tissue swelling. The result is to open the airway and smooth the
airflow. This in turn eliminates the snoring for hours at a time. It also
reduces the noise made by
breathing through the mouth while sleeping.
By simply spraying the back of the throat, tongue and uvula with our special
formula, manufactured using our patented break through process, the soft tissue
is coated. This allows the throat
a chance to relax thus a
reduced amount of snoring. In most cases snoring is eliminated. Snore Eliminator
coats the throat area with a unique patented process of all natural lubricants.TESTIMONIALS from several of our satisfied customers:Lorenzo writes...
I am having a good nights sleep, finally. I used to wake myself up during the
night which was a real bummer as I would not always go back to sleep. Sleeping
through the night is great. Thanks a lot Snore Eliminator.
PS: My girlfriend loves it as much or more than I do.
Alex writes...
My husband uses it for another reason. He has a problem with blocked nasal
passages. While he's asleep the passages close, he stops breathing and he wakes
up gasping. When he takes Snore Eliminator his nose stays clearer and he's able
to sleep more restfully.
Thank you for a product that has really helped us!
Glen writes...
In February 1995, I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea. A CPAP was the
suggested treatment for my affliction, but it did not help my condition. I heard
your advertisement and ordered a bottle of Snore Eliminator and my sleep
improved immediately. I continue to use it and my sleep has been better than it
had been in years. Thanks.

seems pretty copacetic. Last night's spam to the list provided a good test
- the spam itself as well as several of the responses were flagged, as
other list members reported.This morning I piped the messages out from pine, being careful to use the
RAW mode, to razor-check -d. None of the messages come back as spam, even
the spam. Since folks revoked the false positives, I understand why they
would not come up, but not the spam itself, unless that also was revoked.Is this spam just a bad one to test against, or is there some setting in
pine or razor that I am missing?--

2207,"So, last night around 5:30AM I'm woken up by a loud *craaack*, followed by
one of the most dreaded sounds a homeowner ever hears: vast quantities of
water spilling onto the floor. The water is coming from the bathroom, the
toilet specifically. Turns out the water cistern on the top of the toilet
had cracked down the side, and was spilling out all the water.So, after shutting off the water and mopping up, I was left to ponder what
are the odds of having mechanical failure of a large rectangular porcelain
bowl, in the absence of any visible stressors (like someone striking it with
a sledgehammer)? We hadn't done anything unusual to the toilet in the recent
past -- just normal use. I've *never* heard of this happening to anyone I

partnership is aimed at extending the security and improving the performance of the standard SSL security
protocol used by every e-based
desktop, laptop and server. Under the terms of the agreement, RSA Security's trusted security tools are embedded into Endeavors
Technology's award-winning Magi
Enterprise software product. The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and
encryption to every
Magi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow
between workgroups within and
beyond the enterprise.Secure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly
network infrastructures. This
combination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific
security tools for each desktop
application such as Microsoft Project. With Magi's secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration
can now be rapidly, easily and
securely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,
partners and clients without concern
in compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact
highly securely with strong
encryption and authentication across firewalls.""In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge,"" says
Bernard Hulme, chairman and
CEO of Endeavors Technology. ""Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT
managers with added
assurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric
peer-to-peer computing""Endeavors Technology joins the RSA SecuredÂ® Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete
interoperability between
partner products and RSA Security's solutions including RSA SecurIDÂ® two-factor authentication, RSA
ClearTrustÂ® Web access
management, RSA BSAFEÂ® encryption and RSA KeonÂ® digital certificate management.The strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging
and advertising, be listed in
RSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.
It will also lead to joint
marketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on
joint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide
business continuity support.""Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise
products and streamlining the
deployment process for IT managers,"" says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. ""By
combining our products,
enterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls.""About Magi
Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today's Web into a highly secure
inter- and intra-enterprise
collaboration network. For the first time, enterprises can implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for
collaboration very rapidly and
affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this
by effectively transforming
unsecured, ""read-only"" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent collaboration environments, through
the use of such features as
cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical interface, and universal name
spaces generating ""follow me URLs""
for mobile professionals.About RSA Security, Inc.

I'm not familiar with Dell Dimension XPS, and, to be honest, not familiar
with any brand-name computers. Most of my experience is China
motherboards, but I've seen same behavior once. Changing the battery helps
that time. It was big round battery with 'Panasonic' on it.
Computer starts beeping then we removed battery from MB. It even booted up
(well, loosing time and some other things).Just my 2 cents.MishaOn Wed, 28 Aug 2002, Aherne Peter-pahern02 wrote:> Ok, Iknow this is blatantly OT but I'm beginning to go insane.

I'll have to watch them starve.  The margin of survival is very, very,
thin.So yes.  In my particular reality distortion field 'not paying for a

cause suffering if not death on the victims family.  That such an act
triggers a violent response is, IMHO, hardly surprising.In other words, as far as I could tell the people on the train fired the

Date: Not suppliedSince the AmphetaDesk source code is so easily modifiable on any platform, I've 
been seeing some interesting hacks and modifications lately. The most powerful 
of them is l.m. orchard's newest template[1], which provides an insane amount 
of new features, including hiding old items, click counting, and an outline 
based format. More than likely, a revised version of his hack will appear as a 
selectable template in the next version (AmphetaDesk v0.94). Also of interest is Brian Cantoni's FTPStore[2]: _""FTPstore is a slight 
addition to the AmphetaDesk news aggregator. The modified code will retrieve 
the personal channel list from an FTP location during startup and store it back 
to the same location during shutdown. This provides a simple method to keep 
your saved channels in a network location. If you use AmphetaDesk at home and 
at work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in 
sync.""_ It's a major improvement for AmphetaDesk users with multiple machines.[1] http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000228.phtml

Date: 2002-10-08T16:39:48-06:00=== Scissors === I, like most other people here, went through the security checkpoint. Unlike 
everyone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for 
permission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a 
box of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket 
was suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing.     The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my 
    lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. She put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They 
took everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used 
the opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked 
back up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying ""This can't 
go on board."" ""I don't remember packing that,"" I said. I let her confiscate it. I called my Mom. She doesn't remember packing it either. Is there some sort of 
terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? I 
can't see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I'm on? Once 
I'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but 
if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the 
scissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their 
fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky 
mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, 
they use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they 
use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever 
terrorists. *Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was 
using to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The 
nation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  === Waiting for Wireless === Now I am at O'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral's Club while 
businessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I 
used last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, 
I had an Admiral's Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite 
the airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, 
you know)--I doubt they will accept it. === Irony === According to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his 
flight. I think of what I'd say if I ran into him. ""Jack!"" I'd exclaim, as if we were 
old pals. ""Going to the Eldred case?"" Of course he was. ""Going to be a good 
one."" ""Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?"" I'd ask. ""You said 
you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the 
Internet. What ever happened to that?"" I imagine him mumbling and looking down 
at his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. Another announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing 
these airline announcements keep me up to date. === Automatic Flush Toilets === Now I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In 
the first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little 
short...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle 
one mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three 
times. This is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they 
expect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied 
immediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer's web 
site. === Arrival === I've arrived in D.C.--once again, I'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the 
sidewalk borrowing someone's connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with 
Lisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now 
for the meetings and parties. Sorry for not responding to your email. I'm rather busy. ;-)",0

spamtrap, unless it's a Bugtraq message, in which case I revoke it as that 
account (not as the spamtrap). I'm talking about the situation before I 
checked for Bugtraq in the procmailrc. The message was sent to the spamtrap 
because it was in Razor, then I manually revoked it as the spamtrap because 
it was erroneously reported. The spamtrap is not, and never was, subscribed 
to Bugtraq.cmeclax

3398,"This is just an semi-educated guess - if I'm wrong, someone please correct
me!Spamd setuid's to the user running spamc. Since you're calling spamc from a
global procmailrc file, it's being run as root (most likely). If called as
root, spamd won't open user_prefs files.>>From the spamc man page:       -u username
           This argument has been semi-obsoleted.  To have spamd use
           per-user-config files, run spamc as the user whose config
           files spamd should load.  If you're running spamc as some
           other user though (eg. root, mail, nobody, cyrus, etc.)
           then you can still use this flag.
The solution is to set DROPPRIVS=yes in /etc/procmailrc, just before running
spamc. From the procmailrc man page:       DROPPRIVS   If set to `yes' procmail will drop all privileges
                   it might have had (suid or sgid).  This  is  only
                   useful  if  you  want  to guarantee that the bottom
                   half of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on
                   behalf of the recipient.
I hope that helps, and I also hope it's right!St-

|
| Hi All,
|
| I am running SpamAssassin 2.41 with procmail as my local delivery agent
| with sendmail.  I use spamc/spamd so that it runs site-wide from
| /etc/procmailrc.
|
| spamd is run as root with the flags ""-d -a -c"", and spamc isn't run with
| any flags.
|
| When I was testing the program, I deployed spamc from my personal
| ~/.procmailrc file, my ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file was read each time.
| I can see this because I have a non-default ""required_hits"" value which
| gets reported in every e-mail on the ""X-Spam-Status"" line.
|
| Now that I run spamc from the global /etc/procmailrc file, my
| ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file is no longer being read or processed from
| e-mails from outside computers.  The ""required_hits"" value gets set back
| to the one in /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf.  However, if I send local
| e-mail, my user_prefs file is read and processed correctly.
|
| Does anyone know how to fix this problem?  if this is a spamassassin or
| procmail bug?
|
| Thanks,
|
| Cheryl

1051,"FROM: DR. BEN KOKORICompliments of the season.  I would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as Contained in this letter.  Before going into details of my proposal to you, I must first implore you to treat with the utmost confidentiality, as this is required for its success. My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of Nigeriaï¿½s Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who are interested in diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria. In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 2002. The source of the funds is as follows: During the last military regime in Nigeria, government Officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals. The present civilian government set up the contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants !
and members of this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five million, five hundred thousand U.S.dollars). That is why I am writing you this letter.
We have agreed to share the money to be Transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows;  (i) 20%to the account owner (you). ( ii) 70% for us (the panel officials   (iii)10% to be used in settling all expenses(by both you and us) incidental to the actualization of this project.We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk-free. We
Intend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information through the fax number stated above_-:Your Bank's name, Companyï¿½s name, address, telephone and fax numbers and the account number into which  the funds should be paid. The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively. This way, we will use your companyï¿½s name to apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract to your company. We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. 
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my direct Telephone number 234 1775 5791 and my America Internet Fax number 240 744 0416 or 801 516 7986 only.
It was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality. I will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when I hear from you.Best regards,BEN KOKORI

Technology shares climbed Monday as Pres. Bush gave a speech outlining a plan for long-term growth.Tech investors also heard positive comments on Intel by C.S. First Boston, and snapped up shares in the chip, storage and computer server hardware sectors. CNET's Tech index rose 15.22 points, or 1.53 percent, to 1,005.33, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 9.04 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,382.54.Amid news of a weakening dollar and an unexpected rise in business inventories in May, broader markets sank. Recovering some from early-day losses, the Dow Jones industrials finished by giving up 45.4 points, or 0.52 percent, to 8,639.1, and the S&P 500 slid 3.47 points, or 0.38 percent, to 917.92.

Advanced Micro Devices turned out two new chips Monday, but its most anticipated release this week will be its second quarter results.

Analyst Tim Mahon predicts the chip titan will report second-quarter results in-line with expectations, but offer better-than-expected guidance for the third quarter. Intel rival AMD's poor quarterly results stemmed more from company-specific issues than PC market troubles, Mahon says. And he points to other evidence of PC strength, such as Dell's positive comments about the current quarter. Mahon also expects Intel to speak confidently about its new 845G chipset, which he suggests could pressure the shares of graphics chip firms.
